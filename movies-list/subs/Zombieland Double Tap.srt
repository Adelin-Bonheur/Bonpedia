it's my driveway.

903
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:22,239
Hey, Nevada.

904
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:27,196
But see, when I'm in town,
I use it.

905
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:30,637
Well, I'm in town now,
and I'm using it.

906
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:35,670
Keep talking like this, and I can arrange
so neither of you ever uses my driveway again.

907
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:38,912
- I don't think they're talking about the driveway.
- No, I don't think so.

908
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,390
- You happy now? Great. Good move.
- Satisfied? Good job.

909
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:44,234
- Is it me, or does he kind of remind you of...?
- Yeah, it's weird.

910
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:46,994
- I don't like you at all.
- I don't like you at all.

911
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:48,355
It's not weird,
it's creepy.

912
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:53,271
- It's like an un-funhouse mirror.
- I think you double-parked or more perpendicular-parked.

913
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:55,317
- Hope we don't get a ticket.
- Whoa.

914
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:57,392
- Calm down. It's okay.
- I'm just ragging you.

915
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:59,989
- What is going on here?
- What?

916
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:02,072
- What do you mean, "what"?
- What?

917
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:04,914
- Does he not remind you of...?
- Hello everyone.

918
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:07,120
Of...
Of what?

919
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:09,471
- This is Albuquerque. I'm Flagstaff.
- Howdy.

920
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:10,755
Hey.
I'm Columbus.

921
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:11,840
Oh, great.

922
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:16,155
This is Tallahassee, Wichita,
and I guess you know Nevada.

923
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:18,471
- Yes, I do.
- Easy, cowboy.

924
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:24,158
So sorry about your ex-car. I guess,
as I like to say, expect the unexpected.

925
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:26,754
- It's one of my commandments.
- Oh.

926
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:29,320
- Commandments?
- FLAGSTAFF: Yeah.

927
00:55:29,321 --> 00:55:32,313
Just sort of guidelines for staying alive.
I've got loads of them.

928
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,915
- Interesting.
- Yeah, number one is teamwork.

929
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:38,750
- Teamwork. That's so great.
- Thanks. I actually spent a long time thinking about it.

930
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:42,016
- I have rules, you know, which is, like, less biblical.
- FLAGSTAFF: Love rules.

931
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:44,236
Without rules,
everything's chaos.

932
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:46,750
- Thank you.
- TALLAHASSEE: Columbus has quite a few rules.

933
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:47,960
- I do.
- FLAGSTAFF: Awesome.

934
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:48,920
Like what?

935
00:55:48,921 --> 00:55:51,277
- I don't wanna toot my own horn.
- Go on, toot, toot.

936
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:53,477
- Let me toot for him.
- Thank you.

937
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:56,473
- Number one, cardio.
- That's right.

938
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:57,630
Cardio.
Okay.

939
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:59,677
- What?
- I don't mean to laugh.

940
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:03,754
It's just that cardiovascular fitness
is his number 29,

941
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:07,112
meaning he has 28 other commandments
that he finds more important,

942
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:09,715
like, say,
what's one of your great ones?

943
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:11,154
Number 12.

944
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:14,711
The world is your bathroom, meaning you can
just whip it out wherever you want,

945
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:15,760
and just have at it.

946
00:56:15,761 --> 00:56:19,391
Oh, just whip it out wherever you want!
That sounds a little uncouth.

947
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:23,673
The "whip it out" part's for guys, obviously.
If you're a woman, you can reveal it.

948
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:26,911
- Whichever.
- I have beware of bathrooms.

949
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,117
Yeah, I'm just generally careful
around them.

950
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:32,080
- We don't have to compare. It's not a competition.
- Doesn't have to be.

951
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:34,271
But number 18 is limber up.

952
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:36,192
- But that's...
- That's fine. I have warm up.

953
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:40,718
Again, not a competition,
but commandment number 45 for me is,

954
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:41,870
well, mind your manners.

955
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,720
Just because it's the apocalypse
doesn't mean you have to be rude.

956
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:47,634
Yeah, keep your hands to yourself, number 42.
Do you have sunscreen?

957
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:49,518
- Just shade.
- Shade. Of course.

958
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:52,479
It's free. It's everywhere.
Yeah. Number two, double tap.

959
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:55,997
- I have number five, confirm your kill.
- Confirm your kill.

960
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:58,959
- Avoid perishables. Do you have that?
- Sorry. Ziploc bags.

961
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:01,111
- Same thing, different word. Yeah.
- Yeah. Exactly.

962
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,317
I probably would shy away
from the word "Ziploc"

963
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:05,033
because I try
to avoid name brands.

964
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:08,113
Okay, great. So, what brought
you guys back so soon?

965
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:11,113
We was headed for the Rockies,
but the goddamn Bolts...

966
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:12,276
Bolts?

967
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:14,680
- ALBUQUERQUE: Yeah.
- Yeah, the zombies out on the plains.

968
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:16,797
They're a lot tougher than
what we're used to.

969
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:21,909
I guess because of all the running and hunting.
So we call them Bolts, as in Usain.

970
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:25,391
- As in pretty fucking athletic.
- COLUMBUS: Oh, yeah. No, that makes total sense.

971
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:27,995
- We actually call them T-800s.
<i>- Terminator.</i> Yes! I love it.

- Yes. Literally my favourite movie. Well, <i>T2.</i>

973
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:33,439
- Yeah, <i>T2</i> is my second favourite movie.
- What's number one?

974
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:35,750
It's <i>Fantasia.</i>

975
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:42,075
Well, anyhow, the Bolts' food sources are running low,
so they're pushing east, which is <i>no bueno.</i>

976
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:44,152
You know what else is

You know, something with an umbrella
or something like that.
