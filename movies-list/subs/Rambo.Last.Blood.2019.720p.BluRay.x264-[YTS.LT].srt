2
00:00:40,283 --> 00:00:43,997
NWS has upgraded the storm
Telmar to a category 2.

3
00:00:43,997 --> 00:00:48,014
Heavy rain and wind speed up to
85 mph are to be expected.

4
00:00:48,038 --> 00:00:51,236
This is Desert Eagle.
Still no visual on the 3 missing hikers.

5
00:00:52,447 --> 00:00:55,209
Bravo, Charlie, please confirm
CIS with rescue ops.

6
00:00:55,432 --> 00:00:56,314
Come on!

7
00:00:56,497 --> 00:00:58,789
This is Rescue Team One,
Lima Charlie.

8
00:00:58,789 --> 00:01:02,730
Our dogs are negative on the hikers,
but it's getting worse down here.

9
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,787
- Storm is speeding up.
- Desert Eagle, what's the status up there?

10
00:01:06,088 --> 00:01:09,693
There is a flood throughout building.
Gonna get your guys off the mountain. Over.

11
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:14,365
All teams to higher ground.
Big fall of water coming.

12
00:01:14,514 --> 00:01:17,107
Rescue ops - retreat
or seek shelter.

13
00:01:17,434 --> 00:01:19,934
Where's that volunteer on horse back?
He's not on radio.

14
00:01:20,541 --> 00:01:23,977
He's gotta be on his way back.
He'd be crazy to downhill this.

15
00:01:29,413 --> 00:01:32,281
Too much turbulence.
We bring it in before we're back here.

16
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:17,463
- Hey! Hey!
- Hey. Over here!

17
00:02:17,602 --> 00:02:19,287
- Help us!
- Hey!

18
00:02:20,113 --> 00:02:22,739
The water is going. There is
a lot of water coming.

19
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:23,582
Get on!

20
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:26,247
I'm here with my wife.
Have you seen my wife?

21
00:02:26,247 --> 00:02:29,244
- Come on. Get on.
- You got us go and she could be right down there.

22
00:02:29,394 --> 00:02:32,848
She's not. I found her down the river.
She's gone.

23
00:02:32,848 --> 00:02:36,101
- Please, Jaime, let's go!
- I'm gonna go find her.

24
00:02:36,101 --> 00:02:37,048
Jaime!

25
00:02:49,154 --> 00:02:49,941
Come on down!

26
00:02:51,354 --> 00:02:52,906
Get over that round rock!

27
00:03:01,962 --> 00:03:02,841
Come on, boy.

28
00:03:18,377 --> 00:03:22,007
Get in close.
Hold as tight as you can!

29
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:25,134
Are we gonna die?

30
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:01,943
- So where did you find them?
- 2 miles down stream at Base Canyon.

31
00:04:01,943 --> 00:04:04,948
- Did you get a positive ID?
- Not yet, it's pretty torn up.

32
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:12,079
Hey, who is he?

33
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,504
Volunteers from time
to time, captain.

34
00:04:15,504 --> 00:04:17,984
Nam burning op,
but he's a hell of a tracker.

35
00:04:19,016 --> 00:04:20,083
You alright, John?

36
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:26,032
Wife got killed in the first wave,
husband ran away.

37
00:04:26,527 --> 00:04:28,469
Yeah, we found them about
a mile down the river.

38
00:04:32,465 --> 00:04:34,035
You did what you could, John.

39
00:04:34,714 --> 00:04:37,432
And we appreciate
your help, again.

40
00:04:47,774 --> 00:04:48,671
Hey, Mr.

41
00:04:52,636 --> 00:04:53,717
Thank you.

42
00:05:00,402 --> 00:05:01,302
You're welcome.

43
00:05:23,421 --> 00:05:24,201
Good boy.

44
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:03,777
I heard the news.

45
00:06:05,299 --> 00:06:06,586
Two people died.

46
00:06:07,933 --> 00:06:09,405
Couldn't save them.

47
00:06:10,573 --> 00:06:12,832
Couldn't save my brothers
in the war either.

48
00:06:13,778 --> 00:06:17,526
You cannot blame yourself because
you gonna save some people.

49
00:06:18,976 --> 00:06:21,802
You are not in the war anymore.

50
00:06:23,123 --> 00:06:24,763
Only in your head.

51
00:06:25,996 --> 00:06:27,397
It's hard to turn off.

52
00:06:30,677 --> 00:06:33,799
Sitting there, you remind
me of your father.

53
00:06:35,383 --> 00:06:39,011
He would sit outside,
in his rocking chair.

54
00:06:40,587 --> 00:06:43,603
Always thinking,
never talking.

55
00:06:44,216 --> 00:06:46,250
But you have done a
wonderful job here.

56
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:49,260
Running this place.

57
00:06:49,775 --> 00:06:52,557
I can't thank you enough
for letting me stay.

58
00:06:52,557 --> 00:06:54,584
And helping raise Gabriella.

59
00:07:00,116 --> 00:07:01,196
Thanks.

60
00:07:03,982 --> 00:07:04,977
Good night, Maria.

61
00:08:29,979 --> 00:08:31,581
Easy, easy, easy.

62
00:08:31,614 --> 00:08:33,049
Good boy. Come on. Turn.

63
00:08:34,283 --> 00:08:35,585
Hold, son. Hold, son.

64
00:08:44,093 --> 00:08:45,861
Come on, son. That's it.

65
00:08:45,894 --> 00:08:46,930
Turn, turn.

66
00:08:47,896 --> 00:08:49,232
Come on. Come on, son.

67
00:08:50,633 --> 00:08:51,568
Come on.

68
00:09:11,687 --> 00:09:13,022
How did you sleep?

69
00:09:13,922 --> 00:09:15,124
Pretty good.

70
00:09:17,092 --> 00:09:18,828
I didn't see Gabri's car.

71
00:09:18,861 --> 00:09:21,197
She called. She's fine, John.

72
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:23,232
She's at Antonia's.

73
00:09:23,265 --> 00:09:27,336
I was hoping she'd help me ride
that new bald-faced stallion.

74
00:09:27,369 --> 00:09:30,840
She'd like that horse.
He turns great. Great turner.

75
00:09:33,075 --> 00:09:35,411
Yeah.

76
00:09:35,444 --> 00:09:37,313
You know,
she'd be a good trainer.

77
00:09:37,346 --> 00:09:39,782
She's got a way with horses.

78
00:09:39,815 --> 00:09:41,050
Don't you think?

79
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:42,151
Mm, maybe.

80
00:09:43,152 --> 00:09:45,688
But she is going to college.

81
00:09:45,721 --> 00:09:48,724
You think she wants to smell like
horses all the time like you?

82
00:09:50,204 --> 00:09:51,249
That bad?

83
00:09:51,667 --> 00:09:54,571
Not at all,
if you like horses.

84
00:10:33,681 --> 00:10:35,994
- Hey!
- Hey! Over here!

85
00:10:35,994 --> 00:10:37,020
Have you seen my wife?

86
00:10:43,133 --> 00:10:44,435
Make no mistake about it.

87
00:10:46,302 --> 00:10:48,839
We are going to win.

88
00:10:48,872 --> 00:10:51,341
I can assure you that,
militarily,

89
00:10:51,374 --> 00:10:53,243
this strategy will not succeed.

90
00:10:58,951 --> 00:11:00,820
- Uncle John!
- In here!

91
00:11:03,723 --> 00:11:05,592
Hey.

92
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:06,593
Afternoon.

93
00:11:07,827 --> 00:11:09,696
Did you finish
working out the horses?

94
00:11:10,329 --> 00:11:11,765
Yeah, pretty much.

95
00:11:15,935 --> 00:11:17,070
What you working on?

96
00:11:20,272 --> 00:11:21,875
You know what this is?

97
00:11:22,742 --> 00:11:23,876
A small knife.

98
00:11:23,909 --> 00:11:25,945
No, it's Damascus steel.

99
00:11:25,978 --> 00:11:29,148
It's a letter opener I made for
when you go away to college.

100
00:11:29,181 --> 00:11:31,351
And I'm gonna add on
these white handles.

101
00:11:32,118 --> 00:11:33,720
Letter opener?

102
00:11:33,753 --> 00:11:35,688
It'd be beautiful
on your desk.

103
00:11:35,721 --> 00:11:37,924
Oh.

104
00:11:37,957 --> 00:11:41,695
Uh, I hate to break it to you,
but nobody writes letters anymore.

105
00:11:44,864 --> 00:11:46,900
Well, then you can use it
to keep the boys away.

106
00:11:48,334 --> 00:11:49,887
- Anyway.
- Okay.

107
00:11:50,188 --> 00:11:52,231
- Push
- Okay, jeez.

108
00:11:54,654 --> 00:11:57,060
- Have to grease theses hinges.
- I can help.

109
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:59,048
Okay.
How did it go last night?

110
00:11:59,048 --> 00:12:01,048
Well, not that many poople
showed up to the party.

111
00:12:01,775 --> 00:12:03,597
- Why not?
- Because of the rain.

112
00:12:07,024 --> 00:12:08,821
Grandma told me what
happened last night.

113
00:12:10,425 --> 00:12:11,767
About the people who died.

114
00:12:13,886 --> 00:12:14,517
You okay?

115
00:12:16,216 --> 00:12:18,243
You know it's not
your fault, right?

116
00:12:18,243 --> 00:12:19,184
You tried.

117
00:12:21,962 --> 00:12:23,102
I did try.

118
00:12:25,024 --> 00:12:26,062
Do you want to go to ride?

119
00:12:26,805 --> 00:12:28,839
- Yeah, go puts your boots on.
- Okay.

120
00:12:33,195 --> 00:12:35,615
It's crazy.
I'm about to start college.

121
00:12:36,457 --> 00:12:39,075
I don't know why.
I have no idea what I want to do yet.

122
00:12:40,241 --> 00:12:42,010
Did you know what you
wanted to do at my age?

123
00:12:43,849 --> 00:12:45,484
Yeah,
I wanted to be a soldier.

124
00:12:46,006 --> 00:12:47,530
At my age?

125
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:49,016
Even before your age.

126
00:12:50,238 --> 00:12:51,795
Did you like it?

127
00:12:51,795 --> 00:12:56,053
Well, I had some of the best
friends I ever had for a while.

128
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,403
It's gonna be real
quiet around here

129
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:02,766
without you asking
all these questions.

130
00:13:03,724 --> 00:13:06,261
- I'm sure you'll survive.
- Yeah.

131
00:13:09,102 --> 00:13:10,529
The sun's setting.
I only have about an hour

132
00:13:10,529 --> 00:13:11,751
left to ride, okay?

133
00:13:11,869 --> 00:13:15,028
- Why is that?
- I have to go to Antonia's.

134
00:13:15,028 --> 00:13:18,585
She's throwing this thing for the guys
who are going to college in the fall.

135
00:13:20,367 --> 00:13:22,236
Why don't you invite them here?

136
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:23,370
What?

137
00:13:23,403 --> 00:13:24,572
Bring them over here.

138
00:13:25,854 --> 00:13:27,923
Remember what happened
last time?

139
00:13:27,956 --> 00:13:30,253
- You freaked them out.
- Why?

140
00:13:30,253 --> 00:13:32,122
Because you wouldn't stop
staring at them.

141
00:13:32,155 --> 00:13:33,575
Oh, no.

142
00:13:33,575 --> 00:13:36,078
Yeah, I do that sometimes,
but it's not intentional.

143
00:13:37,612 --> 00:13:39,615
Thank you,
but Antonia's got it covered.

144
00:13:39,648 --> 00:13:41,484
We're just gonna
have it there, okay?

145
00:13:44,085 --> 00:13:45,521
Show them the tunnels.

146
00:13:46,821 --> 00:13:47,923
What?

147
00:13:47,956 --> 00:13:49,725
Show them the tunnels.

148
00:13:49,758 --> 00:13:52,227
You don't let anybody go
in the tunnels.

149
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:55,831
No, but they're your friends,

150
00:13:55,864 --> 00:13:56,899
so they're welcome.

151
00:13:58,266 --> 00:14:00,864
- Okay, cool. Yeah.
- Yeah, show them the tunnels.

152
00:14:00,864 --> 00:14:03,001
- Yeah, that would be fun.
- Yeah.

153
00:14:03,567 --> 00:14:06,537
Hey, I'm really gonna miss
riding with you.

154
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:10,141
I'm gonna miss
riding with you too.

155
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:19,683
Get ready.

156
00:14:19,716 --> 00:14:21,052
Whoa!

157
00:14:22,191 --> 00:14:24,961
Isn't this cool?
He's never let anyone down here.

158
00:14:24,994 --> 00:14:26,429
This is crazy, man.

159
00:14:33,379 --> 00:14:34,914
I could get used to it.

160
00:14:36,138 --> 00:14:39,075
I hope she's having
a good time.

161
00:14:39,108 --> 00:14:41,778
You never let me
in the tunnels. Hmm?

162
00:14:43,913 --> 00:14:46,749
If you really wanna go in,
I'll take you on a guided tour.

163
00:14:46,782 --> 00:14:49,152
No, thank you. Too dirty.

164
00:14:49,185 --> 00:14:51,220
It is that.

165
00:15:06,035 --> 00:15:08,237
This is a great place
for a party, baby.

166
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:10,740
Not right now, okay?
I have a lot on my mind.

167
00:15:10,773 --> 00:15:11,875
No, I understand.

168
00:15:13,309 --> 00:15:15,645
-Did you draw that?
-Yeah.

169
00:15:15,678 --> 00:15:17,213
I drew that, actually,
when I was ten years old.

170
00:15:17,246 --> 00:15:18,748
That's a masterpiece.

171
00:15:18,781 --> 00:15:20,283
-Who's that?

172
00:15:22,218 --> 00:15:25,254
I gotta take this. Gizelle?

173
00:15:25,287 --> 00:15:28,091
Hey, girl, can you hear me?
The reception is not so good.

174
00:15:28,124 --> 00:15:29,225
No, no. Yeah, yeah. I hear you.

175
00:15:30,893 --> 00:15:31,895
Tell me everything.

176
00:15:39,236 --> 00:15:40,838
- Gabrielle?
- Yeah?

177
00:15:43,293 --> 00:15:46,229
What are you doing down here?
All of your friends have left.

178
00:15:46,262 --> 00:15:48,632
They made a big mess.
I'm just cleaning up.

179
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:51,301
So, how did it go?

180
00:15:51,334 --> 00:15:54,171
Um, everyone had
a good time.

181
00:15:54,204 --> 00:15:57,240
They kept asking me why my
uncle built these tunnels.

182
00:15:57,273 --> 00:15:58,876
What did you say?

183
00:15:59,843 --> 00:16:03,780
I said that you like digging
and you're a little crazy.

184
00:16:03,813 --> 00:16:05,082
That's fair enough.

185
00:16:08,818 --> 00:16:11,054
I need to talk to you
about something.

186
00:16:11,087 --> 00:16:13,724
And I just want you to have
an open mind about it.

187
00:16:15,859 --> 00:16:17,361
I need to go to Mexico.

188
00:16:18,995 --> 00:16:20,264
Why would you
want to do that?

189
00:16:21,831 --> 00:16:23,601
Because I found my father.

190
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:28,772
My friend Gizelle,
who lives there--

191
00:16:28,805 --> 00:16:31,342
Well, she used to live here.
Do you remember her?

192
00:16:32,409 --> 00:16:34,144
Mm-hmm.

193
00:16:34,177 --> 00:16:38,215
I asked her for a favor,
and she found him.

194
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:41,919
He lives in a town
near hers.

195
00:16:44,888 --> 00:16:49,660
Uncle John, I have to do this.
I need to hear it from him.

196
00:16:49,693 --> 00:16:53,263
I need to understand
why he would just do that.

197
00:16:53,296 --> 00:16:55,999
Because he's not a good man.

198
00:16:56,032 --> 00:16:58,735
- Can't be that simple.
- It is.

199
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:01,672
Uncle John, I've heard the stories.
I know you've been through a lot.

200
00:17:01,705 --> 00:17:05,442
But my world is
a lot different from yours.

201
00:17:05,475 --> 00:17:06,843
No, it's not.
It's worse.

202
00:17:06,876 --> 00:17:08,779
No, it's not.

203
00:17:08,812 --> 00:17:11,015
People don't just act bad
for no reason.

204
00:17:11,015 --> 00:17:13,460
There's no reason for a man
to throw his family away.

205
00:17:13,611 --> 00:17:14,693
He's lucky he has one.

206
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:17,093
-Why are you getting so mad?
-Because you don't know how bad it is.

207
00:17:17,093 --> 00:17:19,095
I know how black
a man's heart can be.

208
00:17:19,128 --> 00:17:21,297
There's nothing good
out there, Gabrielle.

209
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:23,416
-Maybe he's changed.
-Men like that don't change.

210
00:17:23,554 --> 00:17:24,725
It only gets worse.

211
00:17:24,786 --> 00:17:26,155
You changed.

212
00:17:26,788 --> 00:17:27,996
I haven't changed.

213
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:30,223
I'm just trying to
keep a lid on it, every day.

214
00:17:30,256 --> 00:17:32,592
Uncle John,
I need you to trust me.

215
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:35,662
I need you to know that
I'm gonna make good decisions.

216
00:17:38,798 --> 00:17:40,934
I can't control
what's out there.

217
00:17:40,967 --> 00:17:43,069
You can't just
protect me forever.

218
00:17:44,203 --> 00:17:45,738
As long as I'm around,

219
00:17:45,771 --> 00:17:47,541
he's never gonna hurt you again.

220
00:17:48,608 --> 00:17:50,910
No one is.

221
00:17:50,943 --> 00:17:54,280
You said you did what you
thought was right and left at 17,

222
00:17:54,313 --> 00:17:55,949
and nobody stopped you.

223
00:17:57,283 --> 00:17:58,585
I wish they had.

224
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:03,223
Gabrielle, I care for you
like a daughter.

225
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:06,759
I know you want answers.

226
00:18:06,792 --> 00:18:08,562
Just wait a little while.

227
00:18:09,295 --> 00:18:10,797
Grow up a little bit.

228
00:18:12,264 --> 00:18:14,134
Know about the world
a little bit.

229
00:18:16,369 --> 00:18:18,204
Would you do that
for me, please?

230
00:18:22,108 --> 00:18:23,544
All right.

231
00:18:26,944 --> 00:18:28,015
Thanks.

232
00:18:28,763 --> 00:18:30,098
- I'm gonna go to bed.
- Good night.

233
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:32,601
Good night.

234
00:18:55,851 --> 00:18:57,818
- I just wanna know why.
- It doesn't matter.

235
00:19:01,445 --> 00:19:02,645
What's going on?

236
00:19:02,866 --> 00:19:04,515
She wants to see
her father.

237
00:19:09,638 --> 00:19:11,607
Gabrielle, I thought
we had an understanding.

238
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,843
We did. We did. I'm sorry.

239
00:19:14,876 --> 00:19:17,179
But I've been thinking
about it all night, and...

240
00:19:18,346 --> 00:19:20,649
I just want answers now,
not later.

241
00:19:20,682 --> 00:19:21,917
How did you
find him?

242
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,288
Gizelle helped me.

243
00:19:26,321 --> 00:19:27,389
Gizelle.

244
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:37,413
She's trying to help me.

245
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:44,109
That man
is more your father.

246
00:19:44,142 --> 00:19:46,612
Watching over you,
protecting you.

247
00:19:46,645 --> 00:19:48,835
These last ten years,
he was the father.

248
00:19:48,835 --> 00:19:50,702
Maria, go easy.

249
00:19:50,702 --> 00:19:51,971
No. Why?

250
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:53,543
Because.

251
00:20:06,058 --> 00:20:07,127
That's enough.

252
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,128
Tell her.

253
00:20:31,594 --> 00:20:32,529
Okay.

254
00:20:34,318 --> 00:20:36,821
You're right. I won't go.

255
00:20:38,889 --> 00:20:40,324
I'm gonna go to Antonia's.

256
00:20:40,357 --> 00:20:41,726
- Okay.
- Sorry.

257
00:20:45,496 --> 00:20:47,298
It's all right. She's a kid.

258
00:21:05,082 --> 00:21:06,284
Uncle John!

259
00:21:08,786 --> 00:21:10,755
Sorry about everything earlier!

260
00:21:11,288 --> 00:21:12,323
That's okay!

261
00:21:14,391 --> 00:21:15,393
Okay.

262
00:23:39,102 --> 00:23:41,038
Look at you.

263
00:23:56,085 --> 00:23:58,154
-You want something to drink?
-No, I'm okay.

264
00:23:58,187 --> 00:23:59,388
I do.

265
00:24:01,991 --> 00:24:03,359
I'll just sit here.

266
00:24:07,137 --> 00:24:09,773
You know, I can feel you
looking around.

267
00:24:09,806 --> 00:24:10,774
What?

268
00:24:11,741 --> 00:24:13,276
It's a nice house, huh?

269
00:24:13,309 --> 00:24:15,078
Yeah, it's fine.

270
00:24:15,111 --> 00:24:16,747
I can feel you
looking at me too.

271
00:24:18,048 --> 00:24:19,216
No.

272
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:21,251
No. You look great.

273
00:24:21,284 --> 00:24:23,954
I know I've changed.

274
00:24:24,309 --> 00:24:26,630
Life down here,
it ain't easy, my sister.

275
00:24:27,418 --> 00:24:28,725
You do what you can.

276
00:24:29,452 --> 00:24:31,321
Yeah, I get it.

277
00:24:31,354 --> 00:24:34,524
I appreciate you so much
for helping me find my dad.

278
00:24:34,557 --> 00:24:36,393
I mean, it wasn't easy,
but it's cool.

279
00:24:38,027 --> 00:24:39,930
-Let me give you something--
-No, no, no.

280
00:24:39,963 --> 00:24:41,465
You think I'm
some fucking charity case?

281
00:24:42,498 --> 00:24:44,100
No, Gizelle.

282
00:24:44,133 --> 00:24:45,969
- I didn't--
- I was kidding.

283
00:24:47,003 --> 00:24:47,989
Okay.

284
00:24:48,189 --> 00:24:50,191
I actually believed you
there for a second.

285
00:24:50,224 --> 00:24:51,959
You know I would never
hurt your feelings like that.

286
00:24:53,461 --> 00:24:55,063
...we'll go see your old man.

287
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:56,865
Okay.

288
00:25:02,136 --> 00:25:03,938
Hyah. Come on!

289
00:25:03,971 --> 00:25:04,939
Hyah.

290
00:25:07,341 --> 00:25:08,343
Come on!

291
00:25:36,036 --> 00:25:37,972
Here it is, 172.

292
00:25:41,542 --> 00:25:43,044
Go on.
Get your daddy, girl.

293
00:25:54,155 --> 00:25:55,990
Apartment number two. Okay.

294
00:26:54,388 --> 00:26:55,657
I did not expect this.

295
00:26:56,879 --> 00:26:58,148
It's been
a very long time.

296
00:26:59,248 --> 00:27:00,183
I know.

297
00:27:01,984 --> 00:27:03,820
You're all grown up now,
Gabriela.

298
00:27:06,255 --> 00:27:07,691
How did you find me?

299
00:27:09,125 --> 00:27:11,794
It wasn't easy.

300
00:27:11,827 --> 00:27:14,430
You always had a good head
on your shoulders.

301
00:27:14,463 --> 00:27:17,367
Even as a little girl,
you always did good in school.

302
00:27:20,369 --> 00:27:21,871
I need to talk to you.

303
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,343
Just now you looked
just like your mother.

304
00:27:28,911 --> 00:27:29,979
Really?

305
00:27:30,012 --> 00:27:31,081
Yes, very much.

306
00:27:32,214 --> 00:27:34,884
You could almost be her twin.

307
00:27:34,917 --> 00:27:37,987
Thank you. Um, I need to--
I need to ask you a question.

308
00:27:39,054 --> 00:27:40,056
Of course.

309
00:27:41,791 --> 00:27:43,093
Why did you leave us?

310
00:27:48,397 --> 00:27:52,235
I'm just trying to understand
why you would just go like that.

311
00:27:54,303 --> 00:27:55,271
Okay.

312
00:27:59,842 --> 00:28:03,913
Because one day,
I looked at your mother and you

313
00:28:03,946 --> 00:28:07,984
and realized you both didn't
mean anything to me anymore.

314
00:28:09,885 --> 00:28:12,355
I know it's hard
to understand.

315
00:28:12,388 --> 00:28:17,861
But I wasted time
being with you...

316
00:28:19,094 --> 00:28:20,263
and her.

317
00:28:21,964 --> 00:28:24,834
And she fucking dies
and leaves me with you,

318
00:28:26,468 --> 00:28:28,872
who I never wanted.

319
00:28:34,009 --> 00:28:35,311
Any more questions?

320
00:28:38,047 --> 00:28:39,549
You don't need to come back.

321
00:28:50,386 --> 00:28:52,455
Hey, what happened?
Girl, what happened?

322
00:28:52,488 --> 00:28:54,557
I should've listened to him.
He was right the whole time.

323
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:56,292
-I gotta get back home tonight.
-Who?

324
00:28:56,325 --> 00:28:58,094
Fuck that!
You're not gonna drive home.

325
00:28:58,127 --> 00:29:00,363
It's too late
and you're too upset.

326
00:29:00,396 --> 00:29:03,733
Yo, let me help you.
You gotta calm down, though.

327
00:29:03,766 --> 00:29:06,002
We'll do something
to get this out of your mind.

328
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:09,205
I'll drive.

329
00:29:34,697 --> 00:29:35,665
Hi.

330
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,415
Hi. How are you?

331
00:29:50,825 --> 00:29:54,177
- Hi.
- Hi.

332
00:32:19,501 --> 00:32:21,393
John! John!

333
00:32:21,393 --> 00:32:23,896
-What's the matter?
-She never went to Antonia's.

334
00:32:23,929 --> 00:32:26,665
-She went to Mexico.
-What?

335
00:32:26,698 --> 00:32:27,733
Gizelle called.

336
00:32:28,036 --> 00:32:31,261
Gabriela went to see her father
and never came back.

337
00:32:31,994 --> 00:32:33,496
Did you get an address?

338
00:32:34,897 --> 00:32:36,032
And her father's too.

339
00:32:37,994 --> 00:32:39,430
What happened, John?

340
00:32:43,032 --> 00:32:45,836
-Should I call the police?
-Cops can't cross the border.

341
00:32:45,869 --> 00:32:47,604
Down there, they don't do shit.

342
00:32:48,738 --> 00:32:50,774
Please, John.
Bring my girl back.

343
00:32:50,807 --> 00:32:51,742
I'll find her.

344
00:33:27,001 --> 00:33:28,672
I can't control
what's out there.

345
00:33:29,832 --> 00:33:31,501
You can't
just protect me forever.

346
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:22,545
I'm looking for Gabrielle.

347
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:23,880
She's not here.

348
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:30,553
Where is she?

349
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,389
I don't know anything.

350
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:38,528
All this shit
is because of you.

351
00:35:41,964 --> 00:35:45,468
I should've broke
your fucking neck ten years ago.

352
00:36:15,858 --> 00:36:16,644
Gizelle.

353
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,884
My name is John.
We've met a few times before.

354
00:36:21,884 --> 00:36:23,482
I'm looking for Gabrielle.

355
00:36:23,482 --> 00:36:24,585
She's not here.

356
00:36:24,585 --> 00:36:26,261
Do you know
where she could be?

357
00:36:26,261 --> 00:36:27,467
I don't know.
She wanted help

358
00:36:27,467 --> 00:36:29,675
finding her old man.
That's all I know.

359
00:36:29,675 --> 00:36:33,012
You mind if I ask you a few
questions about what happened?

360
00:36:33,045 --> 00:36:34,547
Okay,
but I don't know much.

361
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:36,049
Inside,
if you don't mind.

362
00:36:37,249 --> 00:36:38,217
Okay.

363
00:36:42,087 --> 00:36:43,373
She was so sad.

364
00:36:43,692 --> 00:36:47,230
He basically told her to fuck off,
and I just wanted to help.

365
00:36:47,263 --> 00:36:48,764
Then what happened?

366
00:36:48,797 --> 00:36:50,533
What happened?

367
00:36:50,566 --> 00:36:53,035
She was crying a lot.
And it made me feel bad.

368
00:36:53,068 --> 00:36:55,738
I didn't want to bring her back to
this shithole because it's depressing.

369
00:36:55,771 --> 00:36:57,940
I thought it might be better
if I took her out,

370
00:36:57,973 --> 00:37:00,676
calm her down, get her head
clear, maybe get some drinks.

371
00:37:00,709 --> 00:37:03,079
And then we went to this place,
and then we got separated.

372
00:37:03,112 --> 00:37:04,564
And I don't know
what happened!

373
00:37:04,564 --> 00:37:05,102
How?

374
00:37:05,239 --> 00:37:08,242
Because I drank too much.
It happens.

375
00:37:08,257 --> 00:37:09,459
I was talking to a
couple of friends,

376
00:37:09,459 --> 00:37:11,091
and then I looked up
and she wasn't there.

377
00:37:11,091 --> 00:37:13,139
And I looked for her
everywhere.

378
00:37:13,139 --> 00:37:14,774
And I thought
maybe she left.

379
00:37:14,807 --> 00:37:16,709
I don't know.
I don't know.

380
00:37:16,742 --> 00:37:18,811
She left
without saying goodbye?

381
00:37:18,844 --> 00:37:20,880
Yeah, I don't know, maybe.

382
00:37:20,913 --> 00:37:22,715
Somebody drove me there,
and I don't even know who.

383
00:37:22,748 --> 00:37:24,751
And, yeah,
I said I was fucked up.

384
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:26,753
Was she talking to anyone,
any guys?

385
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:28,087
What?

386
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,323
Was she talking
to any guys?

387
00:37:30,356 --> 00:37:32,825
I don't know, man!
Maybe.

388
00:37:32,858 --> 00:37:34,794
She must've talked
to a few guys.

389
00:37:34,827 --> 00:37:37,897
Why you asking me all this shit?
You think I'm lying to you?

390
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:41,167
You called my house and said she
never came back from her father's.

391
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,935
Yeah,
I was giving you a heads-up.

392
00:37:42,968 --> 00:37:44,938
-Or covering your ass.
-Man, fuck you--

393
00:37:48,974 --> 00:37:50,209
Where did you get this?

394
00:37:50,242 --> 00:37:51,911
She gave it to me, man.

395
00:37:51,944 --> 00:37:53,880
It was her mother's.

396
00:37:53,913 --> 00:37:55,248
She'd never give it to you.

397
00:37:56,248 --> 00:37:57,784
You sold her out.

398
00:37:58,784 --> 00:37:59,952
She was your friend.

399
00:37:59,985 --> 00:38:01,287
Fuck you! Get out of my place!

400
00:38:06,225 --> 00:38:07,193
Look at me.

401
00:38:11,297 --> 00:38:13,433
You're gonna take me
to that club,

402
00:38:13,466 --> 00:38:15,735
and you're gonna show me
who she was with.

403
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:18,838
Or I'm gonna hurt you real bad.

404
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:23,376
Let's go.

405
00:38:34,745 --> 00:38:35,813
Get out.

406
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:49,460
Shit, man.
I can't go in there.

407
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:51,396
People know me.
I gotta live down here.

408
00:38:53,102 --> 00:38:56,039
You're gonna go inside and you're
gonna point them out.

409
00:38:56,072 --> 00:38:58,341
If you do anything else,

410
00:38:58,374 --> 00:39:01,690
then I promise I'll put a bullet
in your head before they can get me.

411
00:39:02,154 --> 00:39:03,422
Move.

412
00:39:27,063 --> 00:39:29,533
I haven't changed. I'm just
trying to keep a lid on it.

413
00:39:32,668 --> 00:39:34,705
My world is
a lot different from yours.

414
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:38,321
Because you don't know
how bad it is.

415
00:39:38,321 --> 00:39:40,559
I know how black a
man's heart can be.

416
00:39:59,097 --> 00:40:00,933
That's the guy, man.
On the couch.

417
00:40:06,104 --> 00:40:08,473
- We're cool, right?
- Fuck off.

418
00:40:08,506 --> 00:40:09,875
Get out of here.

419
00:40:46,377 --> 00:40:47,513
I'll be back.

420
00:42:15,042 --> 00:42:18,013
Start telling me where she is,
or I'll break it off.

421
00:42:20,015 --> 00:42:21,283
Okay. Okay.

422
00:45:27,493 --> 00:45:28,766
Hey Gringo?
What's up?

423
00:45:30,962 --> 00:45:35,876

424
00:47:09,459 --> 00:47:10,427
Arizona?

425
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,189
Let her go.

426
00:48:22,222 --> 00:48:23,424
What?

427
00:48:25,225 --> 00:48:26,760
Let her--

428
00:48:26,793 --> 00:48:29,527
-Let her go.
- Let her go.

429

"John Rambo."

430
00:48:45,868 --> 00:48:47,203
Juanito Rambo.

431
00:48:49,906 --> 00:48:52,242
Wanna know something, Juanito?

432
00:48:52,275 --> 00:48:55,179
These girls mean nothing to me
or my customers.

433
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:59,549
In my world, they're nothing.
They're not people.

434
00:48:59,582 --> 00:49:02,653
They're just--
They're just things.

435
00:49:03,887 --> 00:49:05,989
They have no worth
to men like us.

436
00:49:07,094 --> 00:49:10,631
So I would have not
paid attention to this...

437
00:49:12,599 --> 00:49:13,667
to her.

438
00:49:14,735 --> 00:49:17,204
But now I will.

439
00:49:17,237 --> 00:49:21,609
Because you coming here has made
it very bad for her, cabrón.

440
00:49:21,642 --> 00:49:25,580
We would've just trained her,
used her and sold her.

441
00:49:27,081 --> 00:49:29,150
But now we're gonna make
an example of her.

442
00:49:31,351 --> 00:49:32,754
I'm gonna let you live.

443
00:49:33,966 --> 00:49:37,837
- What are you talking about?
- Shut up!

444
00:49:41,162 --> 00:49:44,065
You're gonna think about this every
fucking day of your fucking life.

445
00:49:47,668 --> 00:49:50,071
Until you can't think
anymore, Juanito.

446
00:49:57,384 --> 00:50:00,427
Mark him, and
his whore as well.

447
00:50:01,952 --> 00:50:04,501
On the cheek.

448
00:50:04,685 --> 00:50:05,685
Cut deep.

449
00:50:40,277 --> 00:50:42,090
We need to
get out of here.

450
00:50:44,293 --> 00:50:45,194
Get up.

451
00:50:47,153 --> 00:50:50,157
Let me help you.
Can you stand?

452
00:50:56,830 --> 00:50:59,199
Okay, you have to get up.
They will come back.

453
00:51:09,242 --> 00:51:10,311
Let her go.

454
00:51:12,012 --> 00:51:13,047
Let her go.

455
00:51:54,866 --> 00:51:56,299
No, no, no!
Please. Don't!

456
00:55:10,579 --> 00:55:11,614
You're up.

457
00:55:12,893 --> 00:55:13,828
Yeah.

458
00:55:15,596 --> 00:55:16,865
Are you okay?

459
00:55:18,098 --> 00:55:19,234
Who are you?

460
00:55:20,501 --> 00:55:21,770
Carmen Delgado.

461
00:55:22,870 --> 00:55:24,072
What is your name?

462
00:55:24,505 --> 00:55:25,507
John.

463
00:55:27,441 --> 00:55:30,111
Your truck is in the garage,
by the way.

464
00:55:32,546 --> 00:55:33,848
How did I get here?

465
00:55:35,616 --> 00:55:37,118
I brought you here.

466
00:55:37,151 --> 00:55:39,120
You don't even know me.

467
00:55:39,153 --> 00:55:41,055
Why do I have to know you?

468
00:55:41,922 --> 00:55:43,224
Um...

469
00:55:43,257 --> 00:55:45,359
You were in trouble.

470
00:55:45,392 --> 00:55:47,262
I don't know,
I would do it for anyone.

471
00:55:48,262 --> 00:55:49,998
Why were you even there?

472
00:55:51,131 --> 00:55:53,001
I'm an independent journalist.

473
00:55:54,134 --> 00:55:56,070
I was following
El Flaco...

474
00:55:58,239 --> 00:56:00,809
a pimp who drugs
and sells girls.

475
00:56:02,109 --> 00:56:04,879
I saw you in the club,
watching him.

476
00:56:06,413 --> 00:56:08,583
I saw what you did to him.

477
00:56:08,616 --> 00:56:10,318
How long have I been here?

478
00:56:11,318 --> 00:56:13,187
-Four days.
-Four days?

479
00:56:13,220 --> 00:56:14,388
Mm-hmm.

480
00:56:14,421 --> 00:56:15,423
Christ.

481
00:56:16,924 --> 00:56:18,059
You gotta tell me...

482
00:56:19,660 --> 00:56:21,295
Where are the men
that took her?

483
00:56:21,328 --> 00:56:23,531
Who did they take?
Your daughter?

484
00:56:23,564 --> 00:56:25,566
Yeah. Where is she?

485
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:27,101
Who are they?

486
00:56:28,669 --> 00:56:30,038
The Martínez brothers.

487
00:56:31,272 --> 00:56:32,907
They took my sister.

488
00:56:34,909 --> 00:56:38,146
They found her dead from an
overdose three years ago.

489
00:56:39,446 --> 00:56:41,015
I'm sorry.

490
00:56:41,915 --> 00:56:46,020
You just gotta tell me
where you think they are.

491
00:56:46,053 --> 00:56:47,522
No, it doesn't work this way.

492
00:56:48,489 --> 00:56:49,991
There's too many of them.

493
00:56:50,024 --> 00:56:51,425
Are you crazy or what?

494
00:56:51,458 --> 00:56:53,961
I'm not thinking about that.

495
00:56:53,994 --> 00:56:55,463
All I can think about is...

496
00:56:57,131 --> 00:56:59,067
how scared she must be,

497
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:01,202
what she's going through,

498
00:57:02,369 --> 00:57:04,205
and what your sister
went through.

499
00:57:05,606 --> 00:57:08,509
Just help me, please.

500
00:57:08,542 --> 00:57:10,445
I can't do it without you.

501
00:57:15,416 --> 00:57:16,951
- Okay.
- Thank you.

502
00:57:18,352 --> 00:57:19,287
Thanks.

503
00:59:12,473 --> 00:59:14,041
-Gabrielle. Come here.
- No!

504
00:59:14,074 --> 00:59:16,077
-No, Gabrielle! Gabrielle.
-No!

505
00:59:16,110 --> 00:59:17,912
It's John.

506
00:59:17,945 --> 00:59:20,047
-It's Uncle John.

507
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:21,616
It's all right. It's all right.

508
00:59:21,649 --> 00:59:23,484
It's your uncle.
It's your uncle.

509
00:59:44,538 --> 00:59:47,074
Okay. We're going home.

510
00:59:47,107 --> 00:59:48,877
You're going home.
You're safe now.

511
01:01:26,514 --> 01:01:27,883
You came back.

512
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:32,823
We're gonna get you back,
get you back home.

513
01:01:38,718 --> 01:01:42,955
- I'm sorry.
- No. You didn't do anything.

514
01:01:42,955 --> 01:01:44,542
You didn't do anything at all.

515
01:01:44,542 --> 01:01:46,911
We're gonna go home,
and everything's gonna be good.

516
01:01:46,944 --> 01:01:48,413
It's gonna be all right.

517
01:01:52,517 --> 01:01:53,485
Okay.

518
01:01:54,986 --> 01:01:56,688
I got this back for you.

519
01:02:08,833 --> 01:02:11,069
Gabrielle, I need you
to keep your eyes open.

520
01:02:13,104 --> 01:02:14,439
Keep your eyes open.

521
01:02:15,606 --> 01:02:16,908
Let's talk about something.

522
01:02:19,811 --> 01:02:22,147
I remember
you were a great rider.

523
01:02:23,948 --> 01:02:26,718
Every event you were in,
every competition,

524
01:02:26,751 --> 01:02:28,453
you'd win everything.

525
01:02:29,821 --> 01:02:33,458
I remember you were
just about 11 years old.

526
01:02:33,491 --> 01:02:36,595
You won five events in one day.
That's really something.

527
01:02:37,528 --> 01:02:39,798
Gabrielle, stay with me.

528
01:02:39,831 --> 01:02:42,467
You can do it.
We're gonna be home soon.

529
01:02:43,234 --> 01:02:44,803
I'll take care of you.

530
01:02:45,903 --> 01:02:48,473
You got so much life left.

531
01:02:48,506 --> 01:02:51,410
You got so many things
you gotta do.

532
01:02:52,510 --> 01:02:53,678
So many things.

533
01:02:56,147 --> 01:03:00,185
When I came home a long
time ago, you were so young.

534
01:03:00,218 --> 01:03:01,686
Gabrielle,
you were so young.

535
01:03:03,688 --> 01:03:06,525
I was lost. I was a lost man.

536
01:03:07,625 --> 01:03:09,795
And then I met you.

537
01:03:11,729 --> 01:03:16,001
And I saw something that I
didn't think I'd ever see anymore:

538
01:03:17,568 --> 01:03:21,606
Good in this world.
Some innocence.

539
01:03:21,639 --> 01:03:25,977
And I had a family that
I never thought I'd ever have.

540
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:30,081
And raising you, it was the
best thing that ever happened to me.

541
01:03:30,114 --> 01:03:33,251
And I thank you for that.
Thank you.

542
01:03:33,284 --> 01:03:34,619
You're like the--

543
01:03:36,187 --> 01:03:38,723
Gabrielle? Gabrielle.

544
01:03:45,696 --> 01:03:47,799
Gabrielle. No, no.

545
01:03:47,832 --> 01:03:49,000
Oh, don't do it.

546
01:03:51,102 --> 01:03:52,103
Gabrielle?

547
01:03:55,072 --> 01:03:56,508
Oh, God.

548
01:04:14,926 --> 01:04:16,027
I'm sorry.

549
01:04:29,807 --> 01:04:31,109
Why not me?

550
01:05:24,095 --> 01:05:25,163
Wait!

551
01:07:01,687 --> 01:07:03,389
I want you to stay
at your sister's.

552
01:07:05,150 --> 01:07:07,386
There's nothing for you here,
nothing for me here.

553
01:07:09,454 --> 01:07:11,090
Where will you go?

554
01:07:12,324 --> 01:07:13,826
I'm just gonna move around.

555
01:07:15,494 --> 01:07:16,762
Like always.

556
01:07:18,797 --> 01:07:20,232
Will I see you again?

557
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:23,436
Mm-hmm. Sure.

558
01:07:29,307 --> 01:07:30,376
I will miss this.

559
01:08:00,642 --> 01:08:01,577
Yeah.

560
01:08:05,766 --> 01:08:07,202
Travel safe.

561
01:11:32,824 --> 01:11:33,792
What do you want?

562
01:11:34,859 --> 01:11:36,194
I need your help.

563
01:11:36,227 --> 01:11:37,830
Come in.

564
01:11:40,999 --> 01:11:43,902
If someone sees you,
we both will die.

565
01:11:43,935 --> 01:11:45,804
Coming back here
is so dangerous.

566
01:11:46,985 --> 01:11:48,068
Did you find her?

567
01:11:48,207 --> 01:11:49,338
She's dead.

568
01:11:53,139 --> 01:11:54,341
Oh, I'm...

569
01:11:55,321 --> 01:11:56,514
I'm sorry.

570
01:11:57,611 --> 01:11:59,981
I really am.
I know how you feel.

571
01:12:01,215 --> 01:12:03,985
But coming back
was dangerous.

572
01:12:05,152 --> 01:12:06,521
Why are you here?

573
01:12:07,688 --> 01:12:09,924
I wanna find
the thin one.

574
01:12:09,957 --> 01:12:10,496
No.

575
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:12,783
- The one that cut her.
- No.

576
01:12:12,783 --> 01:12:14,268
The one that cut me.

577
01:12:14,268 --> 01:12:16,704
I will not help you again.

578
01:12:16,737 --> 01:12:18,005
You have to.

579
01:12:18,038 --> 01:12:19,941
Why do I have to?

580
01:12:19,974 --> 01:12:22,744
What will it change?
Nothing.

581
01:12:23,978 --> 01:12:26,681
We grieve and move on.

582
01:12:28,015 --> 01:12:29,250
And you've done that?

583
01:12:32,219 --> 01:12:35,690
I mean,
I think of her every day.

584
01:12:36,657 --> 01:12:37,959
Every fucking day.

585
01:12:41,028 --> 01:12:42,897
But we have to move on.

586
01:12:42,930 --> 01:12:44,880
What if you can't move on?

587
01:12:45,379 --> 01:12:47,748
- What if you can't move on at all?
- But you have to.

588
01:12:47,781 --> 01:12:49,884
We have no choice.
What's done is done.

589
01:12:49,917 --> 01:12:51,019
Why is it done?

590
01:12:52,519 --> 01:12:54,689
How is it ever done?

591
01:12:56,690 --> 01:12:59,694
When I look
at something so innocent...

592
01:13:01,462 --> 01:13:04,765
and I see that face
never have life in it again,

593
01:13:04,798 --> 01:13:09,370
how is it ever done?

594
01:13:11,905 --> 01:13:13,574
I want revenge.

595
01:13:15,042 --> 01:13:18,646
I want them to know
that death is coming...

596
01:13:19,980 --> 01:13:23,851
and there's nothing
they can do to stop it.

597
01:13:25,452 --> 01:13:28,356
I want them
to feel our grief...

598
01:13:29,290 --> 01:13:34,095
and know that's the last thing
they will ever feel.

599
01:13:36,130 --> 01:13:38,066
And I know
you want it too.

600
01:24:15,683 --> 01:24:16,358
Here!

601
01:24:59,227 --> 01:25:00,229
They're all dead.

602
01:25:01,338 --> 01:25:03,307
All of them.

603
01:25:03,340 --> 01:25:05,242
I could've killed you
ten times.

604
01:25:07,043 --> 01:25:08,612
But I wanted you last.

605
01:25:09,813 --> 01:25:11,114
Fuck you.

606
01:25:11,147 --> 01:25:13,250
No, fuck you, dead man.

607
01:25:14,951 --> 01:25:17,588
I want you to feel my rage,

608
01:25:17,621 --> 01:25:18,756
my hate,

609
01:25:20,023 --> 01:25:22,593
when I reach into your chest

610
01:25:22,626 --> 01:25:24,662
and rip out your heart!

611
01:25:26,262 --> 01:25:27,698
Like you did mine.

612
01:25:32,554 --> 01:25:34,189
You want to live?

613
01:25:34,222 --> 01:25:35,891
Follow the lights.

614
01:28:02,927 --> 01:28:04,697
This is what it feels like.

615
01:29:01,069 --> 01:29:03,572
I've lived in a world of death.

616
01:29:05,039 --> 01:29:07,542
I tried to come home,

617
01:29:07,575 --> 01:29:09,711
but I never really arrived.

618
01:29:10,912 --> 01:29:14,116
A part of my mind and soul...

619
01:29:15,250 --> 01:29:17,219
got lost along the way.

620
01:29:19,921 --> 01:29:23,692
But my heart was still here,

621
01:29:23,725 --> 01:29:25,194
where I was born.

622
01:29:26,761 --> 01:29:29,164
Where I would
defend to the end...

623
01:29:30,632 --> 01:29:33,001
the only family
I've ever known.

624
01:29:35,103 --> 01:29:37,806
The only home I've ever known.

625
01:29:40,708 --> 01:29:44,046
All the ones I've loved
are now ghosts.

626
01:29:46,614 --> 01:29:48,016
But I will fight...

627
01:29:50,151 --> 01:29:52,221
to keep their memories alive...

628
01:29:54,022 --> 01:29:56,176
forever.

629
01:29:57,568 --> 01:30:01,464
