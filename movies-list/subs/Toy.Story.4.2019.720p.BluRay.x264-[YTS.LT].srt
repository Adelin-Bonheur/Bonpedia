1
00:00:57,006 --> 00:01:00,316
Whoa! It's raining cats
and dogs out there!

2
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:02,112
I hope they make it
back all right.

3
00:01:02,148 --> 00:01:04,248
Heads up! Andy's coming!

4
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:07,868
Andy, time for dinner.

5
00:01:07,904 --> 00:01:09,192
Yes! I'm starving!

6
00:01:09,228 --> 00:01:10,443
Don't forget
to wash your hands!

7
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:11,834
Okay, Mom!

8
00:01:15,777 --> 00:01:17,297
- Do you see him?
- No.

9
00:01:17,333 --> 00:01:18,522
Well, he's done for.

10
00:01:18,558 --> 00:01:20,063
He'll be lost! Forever!

11
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:22,006
Jessie. Buzz. Slink.
Molly's room.

12
00:01:22,055 --> 00:01:23,718
The rest of you,
stay put.

13
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:45,482
Bo!

14
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,341
Situation?

15
00:01:47,584 --> 00:01:48,871
Lost toy.
Side yard.

16
00:01:48,907 --> 00:01:51,324
Billy. Goat. Gruff.
Raise the blinds.

17
00:01:52,272 --> 00:01:54,471
They have names?
You never told me that.

18
00:01:54,507 --> 00:01:55,828
You never asked.

19
00:01:56,578 --> 00:01:57,710
Where is he?

20
00:01:59,075 --> 00:01:59,638
There!

21
00:01:59,708 --> 00:02:01,075
How do we reach him?

22
00:02:01,122 --> 00:02:02,711
Operation Pull-Toy!

23
00:02:02,781 --> 00:02:04,323
- Slink!
- You got it, Woody!

24
00:02:04,389 --> 00:02:05,488
Barbies!

25
00:02:13,507 --> 00:02:14,508
Go!

26
00:02:20,855 --> 00:02:22,022
Flashlight.

27
00:02:37,841 --> 00:02:39,174
Hang on, R.C.!

28
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,107
I ain't got any more slink!

29
00:03:28,747 --> 00:03:29,645
Oh, it's beautiful.

30
00:03:29,715 --> 00:03:30,613
I'm so glad to see

31
00:03:30,675 --> 00:03:32,396
this old lamp
go to a good home.

32
00:03:32,456 --> 00:03:34,222
We've had it since
Molly was a baby.

33
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:36,780
Molly, are you sure
it's all right?

34
00:03:36,859 --> 00:03:38,302
Yeah,
I don't want it anymore.

35
00:03:38,383 --> 00:03:39,950
Thank you.

36
00:03:46,747 --> 00:03:48,148
Where's Woody?

37
00:03:56,495 --> 00:03:58,074
Yeah, hi. I think
I left my keys here.

38
00:03:59,974 --> 00:04:00,907
- Woody.
- Quick!

39
00:04:01,008 --> 00:04:02,754
We'll sneak in the hedges
before he's back.

40
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,722
Woody, it's okay.

41
00:04:04,785 --> 00:04:07,167
What? No! No, no, no.
You can't go!

42
00:04:07,245 --> 00:04:08,152
What's best for Andy
is that...

43
00:04:08,222 --> 00:04:09,473
Woody.

44
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,287
I'm not Andy's toy.

45
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:13,340
What?

46
00:04:13,441 --> 00:04:15,423
It's time for
the next kid.

47
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:17,156
Oh, and thank you again
for everything.

48
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,400
I really appreciate it.

49
00:04:18,476 --> 00:04:20,738
Oh, my pleasure.
I'm glad it all worked out.

50
00:04:22,725 --> 00:04:26,459
You know, kids lose
their toys every day.

51
00:04:27,778 --> 00:04:30,345
Sometimes they get
left in the yard...

52
00:04:30,749 --> 00:04:32,950
or put in the wrong box.

53
00:04:37,857 --> 00:04:41,299
And that box
gets taken away.

54
00:04:49,214 --> 00:04:50,348
Mom, where's Woody?

55
00:04:50,448 --> 00:04:52,115
Andy! Come inside!

56
00:04:52,215 --> 00:04:53,588
I can't find Woody!

57
00:05:14,448 --> 00:05:15,582
Well, good night.

58
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:17,616
Goodbye.
Drive safe.

59
00:05:37,382 --> 00:05:39,449
Oh, there you are.

60
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:41,416
Mom, I found him!
I found him!

61
00:05:41,515 --> 00:05:44,481
Oh, good.
Come on and get inside.

do I need to be worried?

No, no. My guys are veterans.

Good. Just keep them calm

Uh, good, good.
Yeah, good.

00:08:17,685 --> 00:08:18,693

00:08:35,495 --> 00:08:37,356
Okay. Bye, toys!

127
00:08:37,637 --> 00:08:39,676

128
00:08:39,746 --> 00:08:41,157
Giddy-up, Bullseye!

129
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:48,491
They went that way!

130
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:49,623
Chase them!

131
00:08:53,452 --> 00:08:55,356
What a beautiful hat shop!
You have so many hats...

132
00:08:55,457 --> 00:08:57,528
Wow.
They're doing "hat shop."

133
00:08:57,564 --> 00:08:58,324
When's the last time

134
00:08:58,424 --> 00:08:59,664
we ever got to play that?

135
00:08:59,724 --> 00:09:01,190
Remember when
she played "house"?

136
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,357
I liked "house."

137
00:09:02,457 --> 00:09:03,491
Those were the days.

138
00:09:03,591 --> 00:09:05,157
It was basic.
You made a house,

139
00:09:05,257 --> 00:09:06,324
you lived in it, done.

140
00:09:06,424 --> 00:09:07,970
Hmm. That's
the third time

141
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:09,378
you haven't been
picked this week.

142
00:09:09,414 --> 00:09:10,758
I don't know.
I don't keep count.

143
00:09:10,858 --> 00:09:12,457
Oh, you don't have to.

144
00:09:12,556 --> 00:09:14,590
- I'll do it for you.
- Okay, okay, okay, I get it.

145
00:09:14,691 --> 00:09:15,724
It's been a while.

146
00:09:15,824 --> 00:09:16,523
Oh, looky there.

147
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:18,591
You got your
first dust bunny.

148
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:20,424
Aw, how adorable.

149
00:09:20,523 --> 00:09:21,723
What you gonna name it?

150
00:09:21,824 --> 00:09:22,823
Uh, what about Dusty?

151
00:09:22,924 --> 00:09:24,008
- Francis!
- Harry!

152
00:09:24,044 --> 00:09:25,090
- Karen!
- Fuzzball!

153
00:09:25,126 --> 00:09:26,169
- LeBron?
- No, Fluffy.

154
00:09:26,205 --> 00:09:27,801
- How about Thumper?
- Tumbleweed!

155
00:09:27,837 --> 00:09:29,616
"Tumbleweed." Oh,
that's good. That's good.

156
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:30,707
He's a cowboy,

157
00:09:30,743 --> 00:09:32,241
so that makes a lot of sense.

158
00:09:32,277 --> 00:09:33,676
So many choices.

159
00:09:33,712 --> 00:09:35,189
I just can't decide!

160
00:09:35,267 --> 00:09:36,076
Bonnie?

161
00:09:36,112 --> 00:09:37,697
What are you doing?
We gotta go.

162
00:09:37,733 --> 00:09:38,234
You don't wanna be late

163
00:09:38,297 --> 00:09:39,971
for kindergarten
orientation, do you?

164
00:09:40,033 --> 00:09:42,690
But I don't wanna go.

165
00:09:42,761 --> 00:09:43,814
We talked about this.

166
00:09:43,868 --> 00:09:44,893
We're gonna meet
your teachers,

167
00:09:44,955 --> 00:09:47,060
- see your classroom...
- Can I bring a toy?

168
00:09:47,123 --> 00:09:49,724
Toys don't go to school,
that's the rule.

169
00:09:53,856 --> 00:09:55,223
Freeze! Nobody move!

170
00:09:55,324 --> 00:09:56,557
Bonnie always
forgets something.

171
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:58,090
She'll be back any second.

172
00:09:58,190 --> 00:09:59,528
That goes for you, too, Hamm.

173
00:09:59,564 --> 00:10:00,697
But it's money!

174
00:10:01,323 --> 00:10:02,356
You all right, Woody?

175
00:10:02,456 --> 00:10:03,590
I'm sure she'll pick you
next time.

176
00:10:03,691 --> 00:10:05,986
Oh, come on, I'm fine.
No problem.

177
00:10:06,049 --> 00:10:06,948
Hey, Woody. Here.

178
00:10:07,002 --> 00:10:08,157
Oh, thanks, Jessie.

179
00:10:08,257 --> 00:10:10,390
We're here for you,
buddy.

180
00:10:10,491 --> 00:10:11,591
I don't want to play
the baker.

181
00:10:11,691 --> 00:10:12,332
Pricklepants.

182
00:10:12,402 --> 00:10:14,969
The hat shop owner is
the role I was born to play!

183
00:10:15,024 --> 00:10:16,451
All right, Pricklepants,
back to your bakery.

184
00:10:16,513 --> 00:10:17,276
Excuse me, Dolly?

185
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:19,075
Woody, can't you see
I'm threatening everyone?

186
00:10:19,136 --> 00:10:19,642
Go back to the closet.

187
00:10:19,696 --> 00:10:21,251
Yeah, I know, I know.
It's just...

188
00:10:21,306 --> 00:10:22,556
I'm worried
about Bonnie.

189
00:10:22,592 --> 00:10:24,476
A toy should go with her
to orientation.

190
00:10:24,533 --> 00:10:26,635
Didn't you hear Dad?
You'll get Bonnie in trouble.

191
00:10:26,671 --> 00:10:28,432
Yeah, but kindergarten
is so different.

192
00:10:28,468 --> 00:10:30,136
It can be too much
for a kid.

193
00:10:30,191 --> 00:10:31,255
Having a buddy with them
to get through it

194
00:10:31,331 --> 00:10:32,410
can really help things.

195
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:33,962
I remember with Andy,
I would go to school with him...

196
00:10:33,998 --> 00:10:35,272
Uh-huh. I'm sorry, Woody,

197
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:36,610
I hate to sound
like a broken record...

198
00:10:36,646 --> 00:10:37,978
but Bonnie's not Andy.

199
00:10:38,014 --> 00:10:39,555
No, no, no, of course,
I get that.

200
00:10:39,591 --> 00:10:40,930
But if you would just...

201
00:10:41,008 --> 00:10:42,590
Places, everyone!

202
00:10:56,117 --> 00:10:57,590
Bonnie?

203
00:10:58,210 --> 00:10:59,852
What are you doing
back there?

204
00:10:59,938 --> 00:11:01,494
Come on, we have to go.

205
00:11:04,113 --> 00:11:05,876
That's my big girl.

206
00:11:05,962 --> 00:11:08,941
Come on.
We gotta hurry, okay?

207
00:11:09,179 --> 00:11:11,055
Don't forget your backpack.

208
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:14,116
You're gonna
have so much fun.

209
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,706
All right. Now what was it
you were saying, Woody?

210
00:11:19,377 --> 00:11:20,846
Woody?

211
00:11:28,221 --> 00:11:29,822
Here we are.

212
00:11:46,345 --> 00:11:48,666
Bonnie, honey,
it'll be okay.

213
00:11:48,755 --> 00:11:50,874
Hi! Are you Bonnie?

214
00:11:50,975 --> 00:11:52,124
My name is Miss Wendy.

215
00:11:52,201 --> 00:11:54,161
I'm going to be
your kindergarten teacher.

216
00:11:56,123 --> 00:11:59,300
We have a special place where
you can put your backpack.

217
00:11:59,357 --> 00:12:00,891
You want to see?

218
00:12:20,688 --> 00:12:22,861
Here we are, Bonnie.
Just for you.

219
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:25,773
Okay, class,
let's all find a seat at a table...

220
00:12:25,836 --> 00:12:27,806
so we can
start craft time.

221
00:12:28,026 --> 00:12:29,040
On the first day of school,

222
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:31,374
you'll need a place
to put your pencils.

223
00:12:31,474 --> 00:12:34,874
So, today, we're going
to make pencil holders.

224
00:12:35,351 --> 00:12:37,075
Now, everyone take a cup...

225
00:12:37,226 --> 00:12:40,760
and we'll use the art
supplies to decorate them.

226
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,108
Hi.

227
00:14:09,944 --> 00:14:12,558
Bonnie.
That is so clever.

228
00:14:12,598 --> 00:14:15,708
"Hello, I'm Forky.
Nice to meet you!"

229
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:17,684
Well, hello, Forky,
it's nice to meet you.

230
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:19,092
I'm Miss Wendy.

231
00:14:21,822 --> 00:14:24,007
Mom! Dad!
Look what I made!

232
00:14:24,106 --> 00:14:25,139
His name is Forky!

233
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,901
- Wow!
- That is so cool!

234
00:14:26,994 --> 00:14:28,806
I finished kindergarten!

235
00:14:29,251 --> 00:14:30,372
Uh...

236
00:14:30,419 --> 00:14:32,786
No.
That was just orientation.

237
00:14:32,856 --> 00:14:34,307
But for being
such a brave girl,

238
00:14:34,362 --> 00:14:35,766
we have a surprise
for you.

239
00:14:35,802 --> 00:14:36,592
What is it?

240
00:14:36,628 --> 00:14:37,477
Since school doesn't start

241
00:14:37,513 --> 00:14:40,550
for another week,
we are going on a road trip!

242
00:14:40,586 --> 00:14:42,473
- Can I bring Forky?
- 'Course you can!

243
00:14:42,574 --> 00:14:43,906
Yay!

244
00:14:48,931 --> 00:14:52,073
And they said I shouldn't
go to school with Bonnie.

245
00:14:52,457 --> 00:14:55,122
We got this kindergarten thing
under control, eh?

246
00:14:55,192 --> 00:14:57,497
I can't believe
I'm talking to a spork.

247
00:15:07,111 --> 00:15:08,678
Hi, toys!
Bye, toys!

248
00:15:09,495 --> 00:15:11,029
Ow.

249
00:15:14,782 --> 00:15:16,139
He did go
to kindergarten!

250
00:15:16,239 --> 00:15:17,131
- I knew it.
- No, no, no, guys, listen...

251
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:18,387
You tryin' to get
Bonnie in trouble?

252
00:15:18,423 --> 00:15:19,518
No, of course not!

253
00:15:19,554 --> 00:15:20,906
You could have been
confiscated.

254
00:15:21,006 --> 00:15:22,640
- What does that mean?
- Taken away.

255
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,048
- No!
- Or worse.

256
00:15:24,084 --> 00:15:25,218
You could've been lost!

257
00:15:25,254 --> 00:15:26,383
No, no, no, guys, listen.

258
00:15:26,419 --> 00:15:28,128
Bonnie had a great day
in class...

259
00:15:28,164 --> 00:15:29,604
and we're going
on a road trip.

260
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,014
- Road trip?
- Vacation!

261
00:15:31,068 --> 00:15:31,857
Yee-haw!

262
00:15:31,912 --> 00:15:34,036
But then something
really weird happened.

263
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:35,764
Bonnie made
a friend in class.

264
00:15:35,826 --> 00:15:36,490
What a kid.

265
00:15:36,537 --> 00:15:37,915
Oh, she's already
making friends.

266
00:15:37,985 --> 00:15:41,107
No, no. She literally made
a new friend.

267
00:15:41,386 --> 00:15:43,303
Hey, it's okay.

268
00:15:43,339 --> 00:15:44,970
Come on out.
That's it.

269
00:15:45,006 --> 00:15:47,436
Come on, there you go.

270
00:15:49,629 --> 00:15:51,639
Come on, let's get
you out of there.

271
00:15:51,686 --> 00:15:53,082
You got this.

272
00:15:53,137 --> 00:15:55,038
Good. Good.

273
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:58,253
Everyone, I want you
to meet Forky.

274
00:15:58,315 --> 00:15:59,924
- Golly bob howdy!
- Look at that!

275
00:16:00,023 --> 00:16:02,189
Look how long
his arms are!

276
00:16:02,289 --> 00:16:04,189
- Trash?
- No.

277
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:06,057
No, toys.

278
00:16:06,156 --> 00:16:07,910
They're all toys.

279
00:16:10,024 --> 00:16:11,624
- Trash?
- No, no, no.

280
00:16:11,724 --> 00:16:13,132
That's the trash.

281
00:16:13,202 --> 00:16:14,924
These are your friends.

282
00:16:15,024 --> 00:16:16,437
Hi!

283
00:16:16,499 --> 00:16:18,123
Trash!

284
00:16:18,223 --> 00:16:19,323
- No, no, it's okay.
- Trash!

285
00:16:19,423 --> 00:16:21,091
Woody,
I have a question.

286
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:22,468
Um, well, actually,
not just one,

287
00:16:22,504 --> 00:16:23,824
I have all of them.

288
00:16:23,924 --> 00:16:25,223
I have all the questions.

289
00:16:25,322 --> 00:16:27,046
Uh, why does he want
to go to the trash?

290
00:16:27,093 --> 00:16:28,691
Because he was made
from trash.

291
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:29,323
Trash!

292
00:16:29,359 --> 00:16:31,158
Look, I know
this is a little strange,

293
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:32,299
but you gotta trust me
on this.

294
00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:32,866
Trash?

295
00:16:32,928 --> 00:16:37,161
Forky is the most important
toy to Bonnie right now.

296
00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:38,088
Important?

297
00:16:38,141 --> 00:16:39,035
He's a spork.

298
00:16:39,105 --> 00:16:41,178
Yes. Yeah, I know,
but this spork...

299
00:16:41,264 --> 00:16:43,255
this toy is crucial to Bonnie

300
00:16:43,356 --> 00:16:45,757
getting adjusted
to kindergarten. Oh.

301
00:16:45,856 --> 00:16:46,581
Woody, aren't you being

302
00:16:46,643 --> 00:16:47,990
a little dramatic
about all this?

303
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,508
I know this is new
to everybody...

304
00:16:49,555 --> 00:16:50,623
but you should see how much

305
00:16:50,685 --> 00:16:52,579
this little guy
means to Bonnie.

306
00:16:52,633 --> 00:16:55,091
When she started
playing with him...

307
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:57,398
she had the biggest smile
on her face.

308
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,727
I wish you could have seen it.

309
00:16:58,798 --> 00:16:59,881
Bonnie was really upset...

310
00:16:59,959 --> 00:17:01,724
and I swear,
once she made Forky...

311
00:17:01,824 --> 00:17:03,640
it was
a complete transformation.

312
00:17:03,687 --> 00:17:05,389
- Uh, Woody?
- Just a second, Jessie.

313
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:09,679
So, we all have to make sure
nothing happens to him.

314
00:17:09,733 --> 00:17:11,256
Something happened to him.

315
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:14,290
Oh, Chutes and Ladders!

316
00:17:14,389 --> 00:17:15,419
Ah, trash.

317
00:17:15,482 --> 00:17:16,500
- No, no, no!
- No! No!

318
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:17,889
You're a toy now, Forky!
Come on!

319
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:19,123
Stop! Stop it!

320
00:17:19,209 --> 00:17:20,755
- Hey! No, no, no! Come on!
- Trash!

321
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:21,944
Trash! Trash!

322
00:17:21,998 --> 00:17:24,242
Well, I guess
I'll just babysit him

323
00:17:24,278 --> 00:17:25,689
till he's used
to the room.

324
00:17:28,891 --> 00:17:30,426
Hmm.

325
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,086
Forky?

326
00:17:34,231 --> 00:17:36,132
Where are you, Forky?

327
00:17:36,705 --> 00:17:37,786
There you are!

328
00:17:37,864 --> 00:17:39,923
I thought I'd lost you, silly.

329
00:17:53,491 --> 00:17:55,991
No, no, no.
Big girl scary!

330
00:17:56,089 --> 00:17:58,789
Like I said before,
Bonnie's not scary.

331
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:00,486
She loves you
and you need to...

332
00:18:00,577 --> 00:18:02,145
Ooh.

333
00:18:18,469 --> 00:18:20,136
Forky?

334
00:18:22,621 --> 00:18:24,222
Bonnie!

335
00:18:24,322 --> 00:18:25,356
Let's go!

336
00:18:25,456 --> 00:18:27,322
Rise and shine!

337
00:18:27,571 --> 00:18:29,379
Who wants to go
on a road trip?

338
00:18:29,457 --> 00:18:31,979
Me! I'm gonna bring
Dolly, and Buttercup...

339
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,981
and Forky, and...

340
00:18:34,081 --> 00:18:36,324
Forky? Where are you?

341
00:18:36,394 --> 00:18:37,840
He's gotta be
here somewhere.

342
00:18:37,876 --> 00:18:38,843
Forky?

343
00:18:39,546 --> 00:18:40,776
Forky!

344
00:18:40,854 --> 00:18:43,280
Come on. Let's eat some
breakfast and hit the road!

345
00:18:43,381 --> 00:18:45,048
Let's go, Forky!

346
00:18:49,357 --> 00:18:51,613
Whoa. He's quite
a handful, Woody.

347
00:18:51,649 --> 00:18:53,082
You need help with him
on the road trip?

348
00:18:53,118 --> 00:18:55,881
No. No, no. I got it,
I got it.

349
00:18:55,982 --> 00:18:57,849
We'll just be stuck
in an RV.

350
00:18:57,948 --> 00:18:59,814
He can't get far.
I got this.

351
00:18:59,914 --> 00:19:00,882
I got it.

Hey, buddy.

388
00:21:00,997 --> 00:21:02,731
Hey, Buzz.

389
00:21:02,909 --> 00:21:03,964
You doing okay?

390
00:21:04,368 --> 00:21:05,799
I don't know, Buzz.

391
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:08,330
I know you weren't around
when Andy was little...

392
00:21:08,988 --> 00:21:11,055
but I don't remember it
being this hard.

393
00:21:12,964 --> 00:21:14,546
Want me to take
the next watch?

394
00:21:14,593 --> 00:21:15,799
I'll keep an eye
on Forky.

395
00:21:15,898 --> 00:21:17,764
No, no.
I need to do this.

396
00:21:17,865 --> 00:21:18,694
That little voice
inside me

397
00:21:18,765 --> 00:21:21,432
would never leave me
alone if I gave up.

398
00:21:21,532 --> 00:21:22,698
Huh.

399
00:21:23,798 --> 00:21:25,298
Who do you think it is?

400
00:21:25,553 --> 00:21:26,186
Who?

401
00:21:26,248 --> 00:21:29,198
The voice inside of you.
Who do you think it is?

402
00:21:29,929 --> 00:21:31,264
Uh...

403
00:21:31,364 --> 00:21:32,398
Me.

404
00:21:32,801 --> 00:21:34,301
You know,
my conscience?

405
00:21:36,498 --> 00:21:39,276
That part of you
that tells you things?

406
00:21:39,343 --> 00:21:40,742
What you're
really thinking?

407
00:21:41,734 --> 00:21:42,964
Fascinating.

408
00:21:43,231 --> 00:21:46,021
So, your inner voice
advises you.

409
00:21:46,099 --> 00:21:47,199
What?

410
00:21:49,076 --> 00:21:51,086
<i>It's a secret
mission in uncharted space.</i>

411
00:21:51,148 --> 00:21:52,182
<i>Let's go.</i>

412
00:21:55,977 --> 00:21:57,110
Where's Forky?

413
00:21:58,349 --> 00:21:59,880
Oh, no!
Forky!

414
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:01,930
Forky!

415
00:22:02,199 --> 00:22:03,549
I am not a toy!

416
00:22:03,634 --> 00:22:04,569
I'm a spork.

417
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:05,300
Be quiet!

418
00:22:05,339 --> 00:22:07,064
I was made
for soup, salad...

419
00:22:07,164 --> 00:22:09,573
maybe chili,
and then the trash.

420
00:22:09,675 --> 00:22:11,076
I'm litter!

421
00:22:11,139 --> 00:22:12,158
Freedom!

422
00:22:14,928 --> 00:22:16,519
Hamm, how far
to our next stop?

423
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:18,505
5.32 miles, give or take.

424
00:22:18,541 --> 00:22:19,476
I can make that.

425
00:22:19,512 --> 00:22:20,884
I'll meet you
at the RV park.

426
00:22:20,961 --> 00:22:22,961
Woody, hold on a minute.
Woody!

427
00:22:41,398 --> 00:22:42,634
Forky!

428
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:46,231
Forky, where are you?

429
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,799
Forky!

430
00:22:48,212 --> 00:22:49,298
Forky, where are you?

431
00:23:07,584 --> 00:23:09,799
- Carry me?
- No.

432
00:23:10,065 --> 00:23:11,566
Why do I have
to be a toy?

433
00:23:11,652 --> 00:23:12,643
Because you have
Bonnie's name

434
00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:14,480
written on the bottom
of your sticks.

435
00:23:14,558 --> 00:23:15,569
Why do I have
Bonnie's name

436
00:23:15,624 --> 00:23:17,317
written on the bottom
of my sticks?

437
00:23:17,371 --> 00:23:18,839
Because she...

438
00:23:20,475 --> 00:23:23,898
Look, she plays with you
all the time, right?

439
00:23:23,997 --> 00:23:25,358
Ugh. Yes.

440
00:23:25,394 --> 00:23:27,412
And who does she sleep
with every night?

441
00:23:27,448 --> 00:23:28,855
The big white
fluffy thing?

442
00:23:28,924 --> 00:23:30,291
No, not her pillow.

443
00:23:30,547 --> 00:23:31,545
You.

444
00:23:31,581 --> 00:23:33,766
All right, Forky.

445
00:23:33,813 --> 00:23:37,315
You have to understand
how lucky you are right now.

446
00:23:37,623 --> 00:23:38,978
You're Bonnie's toy.

447
00:23:39,064 --> 00:23:41,319
You are going to help
create happy memories...

448
00:23:41,385 --> 00:23:44,005
that will last
for the rest of her life.

449
00:23:44,688 --> 00:23:45,646
Huh? What?

450
00:23:47,293 --> 00:23:49,848
Okay.
Doing it for Bonnie.

451
00:23:49,948 --> 00:23:52,263
Doing this for Bonnie,
you're doing it for Bonnie.

452
00:23:52,357 --> 00:23:55,466
Okay, like it or not,
you are a toy.

453
00:23:55,528 --> 00:23:57,047
Maybe you don't like
being one,

454
00:23:57,147 --> 00:23:58,437
but you are one
nonetheless.

455
00:23:58,515 --> 00:23:59,638
Which means
you are going

456
00:23:59,724 --> 00:24:00,920
to be there for Andy
when he...

457
00:24:00,976 --> 00:24:02,276
Who's Andy?

458
00:24:03,179 --> 00:24:04,247
I mean, Bonnie.

459
00:24:04,348 --> 00:24:06,048
You have to be there
for Bonnie.

460
00:24:06,147 --> 00:24:07,913
That is your job.

461
00:24:08,013 --> 00:24:09,235
Well, what's your job?

462
00:24:09,305 --> 00:24:11,911
Well, right now,
it's to make sure you do yours.

463
00:24:11,982 --> 00:24:13,380
- Carry me?
- No!

464
00:24:19,619 --> 00:24:20,720
Who's Andy?

465
00:24:22,701 --> 00:24:24,848
Andy was my other kid.

466
00:24:25,164 --> 00:24:26,849
You had another kid?

467
00:24:26,948 --> 00:24:27,948
Yeah, yeah.

468
00:24:28,047 --> 00:24:29,515
For a long time.

469
00:24:31,241 --> 00:24:33,334
And it was pretty great.

470
00:24:33,934 --> 00:24:35,880
I was a favorite toy,
actually.

471
00:24:37,236 --> 00:24:39,516
Running the room
was my job.

472
00:24:39,641 --> 00:24:40,809
Keeping all the toys
in place...

473
00:24:40,887 --> 00:24:43,657
So, he thought
Andy's room was a planet?

474
00:24:43,727 --> 00:24:45,593
Wow,
that is messed up.

475
00:24:45,671 --> 00:24:46,205
Right!

476
00:24:46,241 --> 00:24:48,296
That's exactly what I thought
when he first showed up.

477
00:24:48,367 --> 00:24:50,890
Yeah. I mean,
how is that not annoying?

478
00:24:50,972 --> 00:24:52,991
- Thank you!
- Seriously, that is the...

479
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:54,700
Well, then you
watch 'em grow up

480
00:24:54,775 --> 00:24:56,764
and become a full person.

481
00:24:58,739 --> 00:25:00,180
And then they leave.

482
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:02,806
They go off and do things
you'll never see.

483
00:25:05,142 --> 00:25:07,734
Don't get me wrong,
you still feel good about it.

484
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:09,423
But then somehow
you find yourself,

485
00:25:09,517 --> 00:25:10,908
after all those years...

486
00:25:10,979 --> 00:25:14,306
sitting in a closet
just feeling...

487
00:25:14,383 --> 00:25:15,582
Useless?

488
00:25:17,094 --> 00:25:18,080
Yeah.

489
00:25:18,377 --> 00:25:20,436
Your purpose fulfilled?

490
00:25:20,614 --> 00:25:22,127
Exactly.

491
00:25:22,198 --> 00:25:24,223
Woody, I know
what your problem is.

492
00:25:24,285 --> 00:25:24,995
You do?

493
00:25:25,089 --> 00:25:26,648
You're just like me.

494
00:25:26,833 --> 00:25:27,844
Trash!

495
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,777
What is it with
you and trash?

496
00:25:29,897 --> 00:25:31,180
- It's warm.
- Ew.

497
00:25:31,281 --> 00:25:32,615
- It's cozy.
- I guess.

498
00:25:32,715 --> 00:25:33,578
And safe!

499
00:25:33,614 --> 00:25:35,460
Like somebody's
whispering in your ear,

500
00:25:35,515 --> 00:25:37,547
"Everything's gonna
be okay."

501
00:25:37,647 --> 00:25:39,723
Forky, that's it.

502
00:25:39,793 --> 00:25:42,599
That's how Bonnie feels
when she's with you.

503
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:44,247
- She does?
- Yes!

504
00:25:46,571 --> 00:25:47,772
Wait a sec.

505
00:25:49,065 --> 00:25:50,797
- You mean she thinks I'm warm?
- Yep.

506
00:25:50,833 --> 00:25:52,048
- And cozy?
- Uh-huh.

507
00:25:52,148 --> 00:25:53,762
And sometimes
kinda squishy?

508
00:25:53,848 --> 00:25:55,103
Well, that, too. Yes.

509
00:25:55,204 --> 00:25:56,880
I get it now.

510
00:25:56,965 --> 00:25:58,111
I'm Bonnie's trash.

511
00:25:58,147 --> 00:25:59,047
Yes! Wait, what?

512
00:25:59,148 --> 00:26:00,569
I am Bonnie's trash!

513
00:26:00,605 --> 00:26:01,514
No, no, no, not exactly.

514
00:26:01,615 --> 00:26:02,943
She must be feeling
awful without me.

515
00:26:02,979 --> 00:26:04,548
Woody, we got to get
going, she needs me!

516
00:26:04,647 --> 00:26:06,269
- Yeah... Whoa, whoa.
- Hey, Bonnie, I'm coming!

517
00:26:06,331 --> 00:26:07,653
Forky, slow down! Forky!

518
00:26:07,708 --> 00:26:09,218
Bonnie, I'm coming!

519
00:26:09,289 --> 00:26:10,247
Forky!

520
00:26:33,534 --> 00:26:35,856
Forky, look.
Bonnie's right over there.

521
00:26:35,892 --> 00:26:37,281
Hurry!

522
00:26:42,297 --> 00:26:43,498
Whoo!

523
00:26:58,358 --> 00:26:59,860
Huh? Woody?

524
00:27:05,686 --> 00:27:06,887
Bo?

525
00:27:15,341 --> 00:27:16,609
Woody?

526
00:27:20,966 --> 00:27:23,328
Aren't we going to Bonnie?

527
00:27:23,364 --> 00:27:25,986
I know, I know.
But my friend might be in there.

528
00:27:26,119 --> 00:27:26,947
Friend?

529
00:27:27,047 --> 00:27:28,733
Oh, a friend, uh...

530
00:27:28,851 --> 00:27:30,147
Well, a friend is...

531
00:27:30,248 --> 00:27:32,051
Well, a friend is
like you and me.

532
00:27:32,087 --> 00:27:33,859
- Trash?
- Trash, like... Yes.

533
00:27:33,895 --> 00:27:35,871
And I'm very worried
that she might be lost.

534
00:27:35,907 --> 00:27:37,967
But, Woody,
Bonnie's right there.

535
00:27:38,003 --> 00:27:40,364
Yeah, we'll have you back
before she wakes up. Come on.

536
00:27:50,184 --> 00:27:51,418
Bo?

537
00:27:51,682 --> 00:27:52,783
Bo?

538
00:27:54,646 --> 00:27:55,451
Bo?

539
00:27:55,518 --> 00:27:56,619
Bo?

540
00:27:58,146 --> 00:28:00,872
- Bo?
- Bo?

541
00:28:00,911 --> 00:28:02,031
Bo?

542
00:28:02,101 --> 00:28:03,295
Bo.

543
00:28:03,357 --> 00:28:05,234
Bo, Bo, Bo...

544
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:08,609
- Bo?
- Bo?

545
00:28:12,631 --> 00:28:13,931
Can we go back
to Bonnie now?

546
00:28:14,031 --> 00:28:15,264
I don't see your friend.

547
00:28:15,363 --> 00:28:16,830
Yeah, okay.

548
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:18,257
She's not in here.

549
00:28:18,359 --> 00:28:19,530
Come on, let's go.

550
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:32,314
Is that Bo?

551
00:28:36,664 --> 00:28:39,264
Uh...
Hey, howdy.

552
00:28:39,364 --> 00:28:40,628
Hey there.

553
00:28:40,664 --> 00:28:41,633
Uh, sorry to
bother you, but...

554
00:28:41,669 --> 00:28:44,631
Why,
you're not a bother at all.

555
00:28:45,005 --> 00:28:47,196
We were just out for
my early morning stroll.

556
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:48,675
And look...

557
00:28:48,711 --> 00:28:50,161
we met you!

558
00:28:50,197 --> 00:28:51,671
My name is Gabby Gabby.

559
00:28:51,707 --> 00:28:54,236
And this is my
very good friend Benson.

560
00:28:54,272 --> 00:28:56,231
Oh, uh, Woody.
Pleasure to meet you.

561
00:28:56,330 --> 00:28:59,581
Well, it's nice to meet you,
Woody. And you are...?

562
00:28:59,617 --> 00:29:00,614
This is Forky.

563
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:01,631
I'm trash.

564
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:03,630
Our kid made him.

565
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:06,200
Kid? Toys around here
don't have kids.

566
00:29:06,236 --> 00:29:07,566
Are you two lost?

567
00:29:07,602 --> 00:29:09,312
Lost?
No, no.

568
00:29:09,348 --> 00:29:12,007
But we are looking
for a lost toy.

569
00:29:12,085 --> 00:29:14,965
She's a figurine. Used to be
on that lamp in the window?

570
00:29:15,022 --> 00:29:16,022
Name's Bo Peep?

571
00:29:16,122 --> 00:29:17,018
Bo Peep?

572
00:29:17,054 --> 00:29:19,457
- Oh, yes, I know Bo.
- You do?

573
00:29:19,535 --> 00:29:21,054
Hop on in.
We'll take you to her.

574
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:22,971
Oh, you don't have
to do that.

575
00:29:23,028 --> 00:29:24,296
Well, okay.

576
00:29:25,943 --> 00:29:28,545
Benson, be careful
with our new friends.

577
00:29:30,488 --> 00:29:31,755
Wow, what service.

578
00:29:37,721 --> 00:29:39,871
Uh...
Thank you for your help.

579
00:29:39,907 --> 00:29:41,233
I haven't seen Bo
in years.

580
00:29:41,269 --> 00:29:43,372
May I ask,
when were you made?

581
00:29:43,408 --> 00:29:44,676
Me? Uh...

582
00:29:44,712 --> 00:29:46,391
I'm not sure.
Late '50s?

583
00:29:46,461 --> 00:29:47,459
Me, too!

584
00:29:47,495 --> 00:29:49,692
Gee, I wonder if we were made
in the same factory.

585
00:29:49,786 --> 00:29:51,457
Wouldn't that be something?

586
00:29:51,527 --> 00:29:53,825
I gotta say,
you are in great condition.

587
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:57,022
Well, I try
to stay active.

588
00:29:57,207 --> 00:29:58,181
And look at that,

589
00:29:58,217 --> 00:29:59,888
you have
a voice box like me.

590
00:29:59,924 --> 00:30:01,589
Benson, show him.

591
00:30:01,688 --> 00:30:04,322
Oh, that's really
not necessary.

592
00:30:08,263 --> 00:30:09,488
<i>I'm Gabby Gabby</i>

593
00:30:09,589 --> 00:30:11,822
<i>and I love you.</i>

594
00:30:11,895 --> 00:30:13,895
Wow, you need
to fix that.

595
00:30:14,761 --> 00:30:16,588
My record works just fine.

596
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:18,797
It's the voice box
that's broken.

597
00:30:18,883 --> 00:30:20,144
Does yours still work?

598
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:20,721
Hey!

599
00:30:20,822 --> 00:30:22,652
<i>There's a snake in my boot!</i>

600
00:30:22,723 --> 00:30:24,906
Listen to that!
Let's see it.

601
00:30:24,942 --> 00:30:25,907
I bet it's the same type.

602
00:30:25,943 --> 00:30:28,382
No, thanks,
mine's sewn inside.

603
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:30,055
Is Bo around here?
Because we need...

604
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,202
Oh.

605
00:30:33,238 --> 00:30:34,923
The store is about to open.

606
00:30:35,123 --> 00:30:37,142
Don't worry, we'll take you
where no one will see us.

607
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,871
Oh, no. We can't stay.

608
00:30:38,973 --> 00:30:40,692
Yes, you can.

609
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:53,005
We gotta go.

610
00:30:53,111 --> 00:30:56,238
You can't leave yet.
You have what I need.

611
00:30:56,377 --> 00:31:00,010
Right inside there.

612
00:31:00,188 --> 00:31:01,833
Returned that lamp
the next day.

613
00:31:01,895 --> 00:31:02,889
You're kidding me!

614
00:31:02,989 --> 00:31:04,835
Mom, can we go
to the park now?

615
00:31:04,905 --> 00:31:06,039
Harmony!

616
00:31:08,506 --> 00:31:10,022
Stop him, please.

617
00:31:20,556 --> 00:31:21,744
What's going on?

618
00:31:23,583 --> 00:31:24,901
Come on! Let's go!

619
00:31:24,937 --> 00:31:27,151
He's coming, he's coming!
I see him!

620
00:31:27,191 --> 00:31:28,989
Forky? We got
to get out of...

621
00:31:29,308 --> 00:31:30,275
Woody!

622
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,300
<i>I'd like
to join your posse, boys.</i>

623
00:31:39,336 --> 00:31:41,567
<i>But first, I'm gonna sing
a little song.</i>

624
00:31:48,248 --> 00:31:50,109
Grandma, look what I found.

625
00:31:50,145 --> 00:31:51,992
- Can I take it to the park?
- Sure.

626
00:31:52,031 --> 00:31:54,787
Mom, she has enough toys
from the store.

627
00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:58,015
Oh, it's fine.
Nobody buys the toys anyway.

628
00:31:58,093 --> 00:31:59,790
Thanks, Grandma!

629
00:32:01,877 --> 00:32:03,878
<i>Yee-haw!</i>

630
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:06,234
Mom, can we go
to the carnival?

631
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,880
We're going
to the park.

632
00:32:07,981 --> 00:32:09,294
Maybe later, sweetie.

633
00:32:16,246 --> 00:32:17,580
Any sign of Woody?

634
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,914
- I don't see him!
- Shh!

635
00:32:21,079 --> 00:32:23,040
Maybe we should
have gone with the fork.

636
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:24,146
The spoon is safer.

637
00:32:24,246 --> 00:32:25,480
Mmm.

638
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:30,548
Forky?

639
00:32:30,764 --> 00:32:31,931
Where's Forky?

640
00:32:32,829 --> 00:32:34,291
Mom! Dad!

641
00:32:34,353 --> 00:32:35,422
- What's wrong, honey?
- Are you okay?

642
00:32:35,458 --> 00:32:37,358
I can't find Forky!
He's missing!

643
00:32:37,436 --> 00:32:39,285
Oh, Bonnie,
it'll be all right.

644
00:32:39,347 --> 00:32:40,955
I'm sure
he's here somewhere.

645
00:32:41,017 --> 00:32:42,147
You know,
if you don't find him,

646
00:32:42,247 --> 00:32:43,206
you can make a new one.

647
00:32:43,292 --> 00:32:45,915
No! There's only
one Forky!

648
00:32:45,951 --> 00:32:46,747
Uh...

649
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:48,013
Let's go look outside.

650
00:32:48,114 --> 00:32:50,211
Maybe he fell on
the ground somewhere.

651
00:32:50,247 --> 00:32:51,728
Oh, poor Bonnie.

652
00:32:51,795 --> 00:32:52,761
We're gonna
find him, okay?

653
00:32:52,797 --> 00:32:55,443
We have to find him,
Mom. He needs me.

654
00:32:55,479 --> 00:32:56,512
Woody was right.

655
00:32:56,548 --> 00:32:58,614
We all should have been
safeguarding the utensil.

656
00:32:58,713 --> 00:32:59,780
Why isn't Woody back yet?

657
00:32:59,881 --> 00:33:01,180
Do you think
he's lost?

658
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,847
- Buzz, what do we do?
- What do we do, Buzz?

659
00:33:02,948 --> 00:33:04,581
Buzz, what do we do?
What do we do, Buzz?

660
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,295
- What do we do, Buzz? Buzz!
- I, uh...

661
00:33:06,334 --> 00:33:07,748
- Buzz.
- What would Woody do?

662
00:33:07,847 --> 00:33:09,547
Eh, jump out
of a moving vehicle.

663
00:33:09,647 --> 00:33:11,146
What would Woody do?

664
00:33:12,179 --> 00:33:13,547
<i>It's a secret mission</i>

665
00:33:13,648 --> 00:33:15,481
<i>in uncharted space. Let's go!</i>

666
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:18,123
I think I have to go.

667
00:33:18,201 --> 00:33:19,513
- Where?
- Where you goin'? Why?

668
00:33:19,549 --> 00:33:20,480
Should we all go?

669
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:21,179
- Are we going?
- And then what?

670
00:33:21,215 --> 00:33:22,675
<i>No time to explain!
Attack!</i>

671
00:33:22,769 --> 00:33:24,614
No time to explain!

672
00:33:24,714 --> 00:33:25,535
- Oh, no!
- Buzz!

673
00:33:25,571 --> 00:33:27,815
Okay, what is with everyone
jumping out the window?

674
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:38,547
Woody and Forky were
last seen on the highway.

675
00:33:38,647 --> 00:33:40,213
But where is the highway?

676
00:33:40,314 --> 00:33:42,417
<i>The slingshot
maneuver is all we've got!</i>

677
00:33:42,495 --> 00:33:44,714
<i>Full speed ahead!</i>

678
00:33:46,982 --> 00:33:48,348
Thanks, inner voice!

679
00:33:54,847 --> 00:33:56,047
Hi-ya!

680
00:33:59,237 --> 00:34:00,238
The highway.

681
00:34:00,938 --> 00:34:02,339
On my way, Woody!

682
00:34:20,804 --> 00:34:22,105
Rad.

683
00:34:23,405 --> 00:34:24,873
Hey! Step right up!

684
00:34:24,972 --> 00:34:25,660
Put your money down!

685
00:34:25,696 --> 00:34:26,797
Get yourself
a real Buzz Lightyear!

686
00:34:26,833 --> 00:34:28,873
Hey! Hey!

687
00:34:34,037 --> 00:34:36,338
Harmony, honey.
Sunscreen.

688
00:34:36,439 --> 00:34:37,639
Okay.

689
00:34:37,738 --> 00:34:39,905
Be right back, Mr. Cowboy.

690
00:34:47,939 --> 00:34:51,044
Okay. Antique store,
antique store...

691
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:52,254
Oh, that way!

692
00:35:10,229 --> 00:35:12,329
Did you see 'em?
How many are there?

693
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:14,730
- Whoa, whoa.
- We got a busload of campers!

694
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:16,964
Here they come!

695
00:35:17,064 --> 00:35:18,330
- Huh?
- Playtime, baby!

696
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:33,831
Oh, baby!
It's a good day to play, huh?

697
00:35:33,931 --> 00:35:35,296
Am I right?

698
00:35:38,362 --> 00:35:39,363
Huh?

699
00:35:48,162 --> 00:35:50,998
"Hello, Mr. Cowboy.
How are you today?

700
00:35:51,068 --> 00:35:53,364
"Do you like riding horses?"

701
00:36:03,163 --> 00:36:05,063
Wanna play
on the swings?

702
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:06,264
Wait for me!

703
00:36:07,362 --> 00:36:08,897
Bo?

704
00:36:08,997 --> 00:36:10,129
Come on.

705
00:36:19,363 --> 00:36:20,297
Bo!

706
00:36:20,333 --> 00:36:22,035
Oh, I can't
believe it's you!

707
00:36:22,128 --> 00:36:22,879
Bo Peep!

708
00:36:22,915 --> 00:36:24,998
I never thought
I'd see you again!

709
00:36:29,761 --> 00:36:31,477
- So, which kid is yours?
- Which one is yours?

710
00:36:31,513 --> 00:36:32,620
- None.
- No one.

711
00:36:32,656 --> 00:36:34,627
- Wait, you're a lost toy?
- You're a lost toy?

712
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:36,355
- That's awful.
- That's great.

713
00:36:36,455 --> 00:36:38,855
- Huh?
- I mean, awfully great...

714
00:36:38,956 --> 00:36:41,823
that you are lost out here.

715
00:36:41,922 --> 00:36:45,088
- Skunk, skunk, skunk!
- Watch out!

716
00:36:45,188 --> 00:36:47,255
Huh?

717
00:36:49,089 --> 00:36:50,855
I told you
not to drive so fast.

718
00:36:50,955 --> 00:36:52,221
You almost ran him over.

719
00:36:54,121 --> 00:36:55,222
Oh, hey, guys!

720
00:36:55,321 --> 00:36:56,822
Whoa! Hold on there!

721
00:36:56,922 --> 00:36:58,822
Okay! I missed you, too.

722
00:36:58,922 --> 00:37:01,822
If it isn't Bobby? Gus?

723
00:37:01,922 --> 00:37:02,595
Uh...

724
00:37:02,673 --> 00:37:03,916
Lefty?

725
00:37:03,979 --> 00:37:05,221
Billy, Goat, and Gruff.

726
00:37:05,322 --> 00:37:07,122
Right! Right! Right!
Sorry, guys.

727
00:37:07,221 --> 00:37:09,088
- Girls.
- Girls! Of course!

728
00:37:10,355 --> 00:37:11,508
All right, all right.

729
00:37:11,578 --> 00:37:14,477
Okay, let's get a look at you.
You need any repairs?

730
00:37:14,562 --> 00:37:16,556
Repairs? No, I'm fine.

731
00:37:16,656 --> 00:37:18,856
Hey! Nice find, girls.

732
00:37:18,956 --> 00:37:20,579
Where did you get
all this stuff?

733
00:37:20,626 --> 00:37:21,421
Here and there.

734
00:37:21,522 --> 00:37:24,247
You know, some kids
play rougher than others...

735
00:37:24,341 --> 00:37:25,678
so I try
to be prepared.

736
00:37:25,714 --> 00:37:27,445
How long have you been
out on your own?

737
00:37:27,481 --> 00:37:29,558
Seven fantastic years!

738
00:37:29,636 --> 00:37:30,263
Seven?

739
00:37:30,299 --> 00:37:32,922
You would not believe
the things I've seen.

740
00:37:33,022 --> 00:37:34,188
Uh, no.

741
00:37:34,288 --> 00:37:35,481
- Gigs.
- Yo!

742
00:37:35,567 --> 00:37:37,856
Come on out.
There's someone I want you to meet.

743
00:37:37,955 --> 00:37:39,189
Be right down.

744
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:45,793
What's the situation?
We heading out of town or...

745
00:37:45,829 --> 00:37:47,391
Whoa! Who's this?

746
00:37:47,477 --> 00:37:49,280
You remember the rag doll
I told you about?

747
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:50,452
- The cowboy?
- Yep!

748
00:37:50,545 --> 00:37:54,480
No way!

749
00:37:54,579 --> 00:37:57,081
- Don't stare.
- I'm totally staring.

750
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:59,480
Woody, this is
Giggle McDimples.

751
00:38:00,304 --> 00:38:01,675
Oh, hi, Giggle.

752
00:38:01,753 --> 00:38:03,947
Whoa, you didn't tell me
he was a cop.

753
00:38:04,047 --> 00:38:04,990
Howdy, Sheriff.

754
00:38:05,026 --> 00:38:06,513
Officer Giggle McDimples.

755
00:38:06,613 --> 00:38:08,537
I run Pet Patrol
for Mini-Opolis.

756
00:38:08,616 --> 00:38:09,717
Yeah, search and rescue.

757
00:38:09,772 --> 00:38:10,950
Ants, caterpillars,

758
00:38:10,986 --> 00:38:12,714
- miniature poodles, spiders.
- Hut! Hut! Hut!

759
00:38:12,813 --> 00:38:14,177
Carl! Where you headed?

760
00:38:14,239 --> 00:38:16,213
Combat Carl just heard
there's a birthday party...

761
00:38:16,313 --> 00:38:17,614
at the playground
on Main Street.

762
00:38:17,714 --> 00:38:19,480
Rumor has it
they got two pinatas.

763
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:21,968
- That could be 20 to 30 kids.
- Nice!

764
00:38:22,054 --> 00:38:25,146
Oh, yeah! Combat Carl's
gettin' played with!

765
00:38:25,579 --> 00:38:26,448
You guys in?

766
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:29,380
You bet!
Woody, you are gonna love this!

767
00:38:29,479 --> 00:38:31,213
Uh, no,
I can't, sir.

768
00:38:31,312 --> 00:38:33,080
Bo, I need to get
back to my kid.

769
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:34,878
- What?
- You got a kid?

770
00:38:34,941 --> 00:38:35,675
Yeah.

771
00:38:35,745 --> 00:38:38,179
Way to beat
the odds, soldier.

772
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,730
Meet you at the
playground, Peep.

773
00:38:39,809 --> 00:38:42,314
Combat Carl's got
a pinata party to crash.

774
00:38:42,414 --> 00:38:45,736
All right, move out.
Hut! Hut! Hut!

775
00:38:45,772 --> 00:38:48,279
So, you're, uh,
with a kid?

776
00:38:48,379 --> 00:38:49,514
It's not Andy, is it?

777
00:38:49,613 --> 00:38:51,446
No, no, no.
He went off to college.

778
00:38:51,546 --> 00:38:53,414
But he gave us to Bonnie.

779
00:38:53,513 --> 00:38:55,413
- You have a little girl?
- No way!

780
00:38:55,513 --> 00:38:57,147
Yeah, yeah.
It's why I'm out here.

781
00:38:57,247 --> 00:38:58,380
Her other toy is trapped

782
00:38:58,479 --> 00:38:59,714
in this antique store,
and I have to...

783
00:38:59,813 --> 00:39:01,647
Second Chance Antiques?

784
00:39:01,746 --> 00:39:03,112
We know that store.

785
00:39:03,213 --> 00:39:04,571
That's great.
That is great!

786
00:39:04,642 --> 00:39:06,247
If you know the store,
you could really

787
00:39:06,346 --> 00:39:07,470
- help me find him...
- No way.

788
00:39:07,556 --> 00:39:08,488
We wasted years there,

789
00:39:08,524 --> 00:39:10,543
just sitting on the shelf,
collecting dust.

790
00:39:10,579 --> 00:39:12,080
Oh, Bo, that's awful.

791
00:39:12,179 --> 00:39:13,488
But I don't have a choice.

792
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:15,113
I have to get that toy
from Gabby.

793
00:39:15,212 --> 00:39:16,887
Whoa. Steer clear
of that weirdo.

794
00:39:16,923 --> 00:39:19,164
If I were you, I'd cut
my losses and go home.

795
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,347
But Bonnie needs him
to get through kindergarten.

796
00:39:21,447 --> 00:39:23,752
Kids lose toys every day.
Bonnie will get over it.

797
00:39:23,822 --> 00:39:24,908
No, no...

798
00:39:24,963 --> 00:39:28,905
You see, Bonnie needs him
just like Molly needed you.

799
00:39:30,182 --> 00:39:32,079
Aw, no. Sorry, girls.

800
00:39:32,179 --> 00:39:33,379
Molly's not here.

801
00:39:33,479 --> 00:39:35,632
Molly? Bo,
I didn't know you had a kid.

802
00:39:35,668 --> 00:39:37,227
That was a long time ago.

803
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,981
Oh, Bo's kid was
something special.

804
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,647
She was the cutest thing...

805
00:39:41,746 --> 00:39:43,681
but so afraid
of the dark.

806
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:45,213
It was just a phase.

807
00:39:45,313 --> 00:39:46,808
Oh, you weren't there
in the beginning.

808
00:39:46,844 --> 00:39:48,547
Hearing Molly cry
each night...

809
00:39:48,647 --> 00:39:51,260
it broke every
toy's heart.

810
00:39:51,513 --> 00:39:54,380
And then,
Bo came into the room.

811
00:39:54,604 --> 00:39:58,472
Her lamp was the only thing
that made Molly feel safe.

812
00:39:58,571 --> 00:40:00,434
Mom would let her
keep Bo on all night.

813
00:40:00,488 --> 00:40:02,571
Ha! Who knew you were
such a softy?

814
00:40:02,671 --> 00:40:03,806
And Molly would
fall asleep

815
00:40:03,905 --> 00:40:06,155
with her hand
resting on Bo's feet.

816
00:40:06,234 --> 00:40:08,605
Okay! Okay. I get it.

817
00:40:09,738 --> 00:40:13,238
Bo, my kid really
needs this toy.

818
00:40:13,337 --> 00:40:16,304
Will you help me?
For old times' sake.

819
00:40:18,171 --> 00:40:19,471
All right, all right.

820
00:40:19,572 --> 00:40:21,305
Thank you! Oh!

821
00:40:21,405 --> 00:40:22,539
- Oh, thank you!
- All right.

822
00:40:22,638 --> 00:40:24,571
Guess we're doing this.
Let's ride!

823
00:40:26,938 --> 00:40:30,106
Second Chance Antiques,
and step on it.

824
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,666
Ow!

825
00:40:51,203 --> 00:40:52,405
Hey, hey!

826
00:40:52,505 --> 00:40:54,738
- Benson, are we finished?
- Ow!

827
00:40:54,838 --> 00:40:56,596
Oh, that feels great!

828
00:40:56,666 --> 00:40:58,272
Look at that!
Good as new.

829
00:40:58,372 --> 00:41:01,177
Yeah. Thank you,
uh, Benson.

830
00:41:02,504 --> 00:41:05,132
Uh, so, um, when's Woody
coming back?

831
00:41:05,221 --> 00:41:07,048
Like I said, soon.

832
00:41:07,084 --> 00:41:08,455
He won't forget
about you.

833
00:41:08,491 --> 00:41:09,355
How do you know?

834
00:41:09,454 --> 00:41:11,773
You have your child's name
written on your feet.

835
00:41:11,809 --> 00:41:13,322
Sticks.

836
00:41:13,421 --> 00:41:15,636
That makes you
a very important toy.

837
00:41:15,714 --> 00:41:17,622
That's exactly
what Woody says.

838
00:41:17,722 --> 00:41:19,288
Hmm. Interesting.

839
00:41:19,388 --> 00:41:20,721
Hi, Grandma!
We're back!

840
00:41:20,757 --> 00:41:21,802
She's back.

841
00:41:23,234 --> 00:41:24,602
Who is she?

842
00:41:25,221 --> 00:41:26,288
Harmony.

843
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:27,533
Wait a second...

844
00:41:27,626 --> 00:41:28,725
she took Woody.

845
00:41:28,811 --> 00:41:30,288
Did she lose him?

846
00:41:30,388 --> 00:41:33,455
No. My Harmony is perfect.

847
00:41:37,085 --> 00:41:39,282
Forky, it's tea time.
It's tea time.

848
00:41:39,363 --> 00:41:41,315
Whoo-hoo!
What is tea time?

849
00:41:41,361 --> 00:41:42,528
Oh, I'll show you.

850
00:41:43,884 --> 00:41:47,777
A little bit of milk,
two lumps of sugar.

851
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:56,620
I've been practicing.
How do I look?

852
00:41:57,124 --> 00:41:59,058
Uh... A little higher.

853
00:41:59,229 --> 00:42:00,862
Stick out
your pinky.

854
00:42:01,211 --> 00:42:02,712
Nice!

855
00:42:02,812 --> 00:42:04,412
Mmm! Delicious!

856
00:42:04,622 --> 00:42:06,334
Harmony,
sweetie, I'm leaving.

857
00:42:06,416 --> 00:42:07,715
Come give me a hug.

858
00:42:07,772 --> 00:42:10,143
Bye, Mom.
I love you.

859
00:42:22,944 --> 00:42:25,110
When my voice box is fixed...

860
00:42:26,354 --> 00:42:28,788
I'll finally get my chance.

861
00:42:41,288 --> 00:42:43,621
Now, about our friend Woody.

862
00:42:43,721 --> 00:42:46,499
I wanna know
everything about him.

863
00:42:46,593 --> 00:42:47,501
Oh, yeah, Woody.

864
00:42:47,579 --> 00:42:49,719
I've known that guy
my whole life. Two days!

865
00:42:49,797 --> 00:42:52,097
Hey, did you know that
Bonnie was not his first kid?

866
00:42:52,191 --> 00:42:54,222
He had this other kid, Andy.

867
00:42:54,322 --> 00:42:54,938
And you know what?

868
00:42:54,974 --> 00:42:56,455
I don't think
he's ever gotten over him.

869
00:43:08,422 --> 00:43:10,388
Psst. Hey, Lightyear.

870
00:43:10,487 --> 00:43:11,924
Hey, up here,
Astro-boy.

871
00:43:12,018 --> 00:43:13,488
If you think you can
just show up

872
00:43:13,588 --> 00:43:15,566
and take our
top prize spot...

873
00:43:15,651 --> 00:43:16,622
- you're wrong!
- Dead wrong!

874
00:43:16,722 --> 00:43:18,488
You don't understand.
I'm trying to...

875
00:43:18,588 --> 00:43:20,655
Cheat the system and get
with a kid? Yeah, we know.

876
00:43:20,755 --> 00:43:22,018
No, I need...

877
00:43:22,096 --> 00:43:24,362
A child to shower you
with unconditional love?

878
00:43:24,425 --> 00:43:25,702
Join the club, pal.

879
00:43:25,788 --> 00:43:26,489
Yeah, join the club!

880
00:43:26,589 --> 00:43:28,033
Come on, help me
get outta here.

881
00:43:28,069 --> 00:43:30,095
I'll help you.
With my foot!

882
00:43:30,131 --> 00:43:31,355
Get him.

883
00:43:31,454 --> 00:43:33,219
Get him.

884
00:43:33,255 --> 00:43:34,622
- Bunny, what are you doing?
- Hmm?

885
00:43:34,721 --> 00:43:36,754
I can't reach him.
Help me out here, come on.

886
00:43:36,855 --> 00:43:39,082
Oh, sorry, Ducky. I'm not
a mind reader, you know.

887
00:43:39,152 --> 00:43:40,987
What's not
to understand, hmm?

888
00:43:41,023 --> 00:43:42,034
You gonna make me say it?

889
00:43:42,070 --> 00:43:43,489
What?

890
00:43:43,588 --> 00:43:44,689
With these tiny legs,

891
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:46,221
I cannot reach
without your help.

892
00:43:46,321 --> 00:43:47,354
Uh-huh. Okay?
This is what

893
00:43:47,454 --> 00:43:48,497
I've been talking about,
Bunny.

894
00:43:48,533 --> 00:43:49,671
You need to work
on paying attention

895
00:43:49,707 --> 00:43:51,142
and your listening skills.

896
00:43:51,178 --> 00:43:52,288
Ha!

897
00:43:52,387 --> 00:43:53,888
How you like that,
cheater? Huh?

898
00:43:53,988 --> 00:43:56,421
Yeah!

899
00:43:56,521 --> 00:43:59,948
Oh, to infinity
and my foot! Boom!

900
00:44:00,406 --> 00:44:02,521
In a galaxy far, far away,
you got kicked in the head!

901
00:44:02,622 --> 00:44:03,267
Boom!

902
00:44:03,330 --> 00:44:05,121
How do I get out of here?

903
00:44:05,222 --> 00:44:06,555
<i>This planet is toxic.</i>

904
00:44:06,654 --> 00:44:08,421
<i>Closing helmet
to conserve oxygen.</i>

905
00:44:08,522 --> 00:44:10,524
In the vacuum of space,
they cannot hear you scream!

906
00:44:10,587 --> 00:44:11,789
Ow!

907
00:44:11,888 --> 00:44:12,889
Let go of me!

908
00:44:12,988 --> 00:44:15,266
Get off of me!

909
00:44:15,605 --> 00:44:17,060
Ooh! So, that's what
gravity feel like.

910
00:44:17,096 --> 00:44:17,998
Yeah, that's it.

911
00:44:18,034 --> 00:44:19,168
Hey, where you going?

912
00:44:20,306 --> 00:44:21,781
You better get
over here, spaceman!

913
00:44:21,843 --> 00:44:23,321
Yeah, put us
back up there!

914
00:44:23,422 --> 00:44:25,387
Bunny, what are you doing?
He's getting away, let's go!

915
00:44:25,487 --> 00:44:26,622
- I'm trying!
- Come on!

916
00:44:28,913 --> 00:44:30,980
Antique store,
here we come!

917
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:32,846
Bo, why do you ride
around in a skunk?

918
00:44:32,946 --> 00:44:35,046
Whoa! Skunk!

919
00:44:35,147 --> 00:44:36,447
A skunk!

920
00:44:36,547 --> 00:44:37,946
Oh, I get it. Smart.

921
00:44:38,046 --> 00:44:39,846
Corndogs,
corndogs, corndogs!

922
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:47,547
Why are you
so bad at driving?

923
00:44:47,646 --> 00:44:49,579
You got six eyes.

924
00:44:49,679 --> 00:44:51,080
Thanks for the landing.

925
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:54,447
- Uh...
- Come on, follow me.

926
00:44:59,747 --> 00:45:00,979
- I'm fine.
- His face!

927
00:45:01,079 --> 00:45:02,346
- That's hilarious.
- I'm fine. Don't worry.

928
00:45:02,446 --> 00:45:03,913
Happens all the time.

929
00:45:04,014 --> 00:45:05,114
Tape!

930
00:45:05,213 --> 00:45:06,513
Not a bad hiding spot.

931
00:45:06,613 --> 00:45:07,847
Yeah.
Leave the skunk.

932
00:45:07,947 --> 00:45:09,412
- We'll fix it later.
- 10-4.

933
00:45:09,512 --> 00:45:10,979
This will be more fun.

934
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:13,847
Let's get you
to that store!

935
00:45:13,987 --> 00:45:16,208
Okay, spill it.
The cowboy, what's the deal?

936
00:45:16,279 --> 00:45:17,713
- There's no deal.
- Uh-huh.

937
00:45:17,814 --> 00:45:20,117
Don't do this to yourself.
Cowboy's got a kid.

938
00:45:20,187 --> 00:45:22,110
- Giggle...
- Trust me. I've been there.

939
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:24,479
You know about me and He-Man.
I'm not proud.

940
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:25,780
Shh! Here he comes!

941
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:27,580
- Oh, man...
- What?

942
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:28,879
No, not you.

943
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:31,214
Second Chance Antiques,
straight ahead.

944
00:45:31,250 --> 00:45:32,594
Heavy foot traffic
at the entrance.

945
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:34,505
Easiest way in is

946
00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:35,856
- the roof.
- The roof!

947
00:45:36,046 --> 00:45:38,047
Let's go antiquing.

948
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:42,980
Hold on!

949
00:45:43,545 --> 00:45:44,747
Huh?

950
00:45:45,108 --> 00:45:46,176
Whoa!

951
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:47,751
How did you end up here?

952
00:45:47,914 --> 00:45:49,513
I thought you were given
to a new family.

953
00:45:49,613 --> 00:45:50,714
Oh, you know
how it goes.

954
00:45:50,813 --> 00:45:52,080
Their little girl grew up

955
00:45:52,179 --> 00:45:54,713
and didn't need me anymore,
so...

956
00:45:54,813 --> 00:45:56,191
Oh, I'm sorry, Bo.

957
00:45:56,269 --> 00:45:58,207
Eh, who needs
a kid's room...

958
00:45:58,285 --> 00:46:02,613
when you can have
all of this?

959
00:46:14,947 --> 00:46:16,454
Whatcha looking at,
Sheriff?

960
00:46:16,546 --> 00:46:18,220
What? Oh, uh...

961
00:46:18,271 --> 00:46:20,462
That wasn't...
No, uh, nothing.

962
00:46:20,533 --> 00:46:22,724
I was looking at the store.
Right there.

963
00:46:22,810 --> 00:46:24,626
I was looking
at the antique store.

964
00:46:24,662 --> 00:46:26,579
- Giggle, count us down.
- Five.

965
00:46:26,696 --> 00:46:27,847
- Countdown for what?
- Four.

966
00:46:27,947 --> 00:46:29,236
You want to get to the
store, don't you?

967
00:46:29,290 --> 00:46:29,980
Three. Two. One!

968
00:46:41,545 --> 00:46:43,579
The highway exit
has to be somewhere.

969
00:46:43,679 --> 00:46:44,913
Where is it?

970
00:46:45,013 --> 00:46:47,579
<i>Meteor shower! Look out!</i>

971
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,113
Woody?

972
00:46:49,213 --> 00:46:50,980
Good work, inner voice.

973
00:46:51,078 --> 00:46:53,586
So, how about you?
How's your new kid?

974
00:46:53,656 --> 00:46:55,947
Bonnie?
Oh, she's great.

975
00:46:56,046 --> 00:46:57,162
Jessie is loving it.

976
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:58,479
Jessie's still with you?

977
00:46:58,579 --> 00:47:00,512
Oh, yeah, the whole gang's
still together.

978
00:47:00,613 --> 00:47:02,521
Well, I mean,
most of us.

979
00:47:04,513 --> 00:47:05,553
What about Rex?

980
00:47:05,655 --> 00:47:07,832
Yeah, yeah, Rex,
Bullseye, Slinky...

981
00:47:07,905 --> 00:47:09,536
- the Potato Heads...
- Buzz?

982
00:47:09,625 --> 00:47:10,959
Yeah, Buzz, too.

983
00:47:11,053 --> 00:47:13,748
I cannot wait to see his face
when he hears that I found...

984
00:47:13,829 --> 00:47:15,662
- Bo Peep?
- Buzz!

985
00:47:15,784 --> 00:47:17,485
- My old moving buddy!
- Buzz?

986
00:47:17,672 --> 00:47:18,738
It's so good to see you!

987
00:47:18,838 --> 00:47:20,072
Woody, it's Bo Peep!

988
00:47:20,171 --> 00:47:21,704
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

989
00:47:23,038 --> 00:47:24,039
<i>Buzz... Buzz... Buzz...</i>

990
00:47:24,138 --> 00:47:25,604
<i>Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!</i>

991
00:47:25,704 --> 00:47:26,938
- Three years!
- Three years!

992
00:47:27,038 --> 00:47:27,872
That's how long
we've been

993
00:47:27,908 --> 00:47:29,467
hanging up there
waiting for a kid!

994
00:47:29,503 --> 00:47:30,526
Look, I'm sorry
about that.

995
00:47:30,604 --> 00:47:32,505
You ruined our lives.
Shame on you!

996
00:47:32,604 --> 00:47:34,204
Who are these guys?

997
00:47:34,305 --> 00:47:36,072
- Lightyear promised us a kid.
- You did what?

998
00:47:36,171 --> 00:47:37,771
I did not.

999
00:47:37,871 --> 00:47:39,137
- Hey! Wait a minute!
- Eat my plush!

1000
00:47:39,237 --> 00:47:40,604
All right now,
come on, stop it!

1001
00:47:40,705 --> 00:47:41,705
Cut it out now!

1002
00:47:41,804 --> 00:47:42,805
Come on, guys,
break it up.

1003
00:47:42,904 --> 00:47:43,938
Guys, I have a kid!

1004
00:47:44,039 --> 00:47:46,003
You got a kid?

1005
00:47:46,039 --> 00:47:47,308
Like a kid-kid?

1006
00:47:47,344 --> 00:47:49,771
Like a human kid,
not a baby goat?

1007
00:47:49,872 --> 00:47:51,967
Yeah. Now let go of Buzz
and come with me.

1008
00:47:52,061 --> 00:47:53,191
I'll take you to Bonnie.

1009
00:47:53,227 --> 00:47:54,671
- We're gettin' a kid?
- Yes!

1010
00:47:54,771 --> 00:47:56,038
We're gettin' a kid?

1011
00:47:56,138 --> 00:47:57,805
- <i>♪ We're gonna get a kid</i>
- <i>♪ Kid</i>

1012
00:47:57,904 --> 00:47:59,504
- <i>♪ We're getting a kid</i>
- All right, let's go.

1013
00:47:59,605 --> 00:48:00,533
- <i>♪ We gonna get something, oh</i>
- <i>♪ We gonna uh, uh, uh</i>

1014
00:48:00,587 --> 00:48:03,004
- Where's Forky?
- Long story.

1015
00:48:03,104 --> 00:48:05,805
- <i>♪ Kid, we get a kid</i>
- <i>♪ Kid, kid, kid</i>

1016
00:48:05,905 --> 00:48:08,472
- <i>♪ We gonna kid ♪</i>
- <i>♪ We gonna kid, kid ♪</i>

1017
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:12,204
He's not anywhere.

1018
00:48:12,305 --> 00:48:14,505
Forky's gone.

1019
00:48:14,604 --> 00:48:16,289
Oh, honey,
I'm sorry.

1020
00:48:16,375 --> 00:48:18,671
Okay. Let's look outside
one more time.

1021
00:48:18,772 --> 00:48:21,472
But then we have to
keep driving, okay?

1022
00:48:24,638 --> 00:48:25,939
They're about to leave!

1023
00:48:26,039 --> 00:48:27,238
- Leaving?
- They can't do that!

1024
00:48:27,337 --> 00:48:29,638
The panic is attacking me!

1025
00:48:29,738 --> 00:48:31,737
- Hey! Watch it, buddy!
- What do we do?

1026
00:48:31,837 --> 00:48:33,471
- We have to stop them!
- How?

1027
00:48:33,572 --> 00:48:35,672
We could frame Dad for a
crime so he goes to jail.

1028
00:48:35,771 --> 00:48:38,171
Or go back in time and warn
Woody about the future.

1029
00:48:38,270 --> 00:48:40,066
That's crazy.
Time is a flat circle.

1030
00:48:40,136 --> 00:48:40,838
Jessie!

1031
00:48:44,841 --> 00:48:46,241
I'm sorry, Bonnie.

1032
00:48:46,311 --> 00:48:47,179
We looked everywhere.

1033
00:48:47,215 --> 00:48:48,572
But we need
to get going now, okay?

1034
00:48:48,608 --> 00:48:50,055
Can we please leave
a note for Forky...

1035
00:48:50,091 --> 00:48:51,708
so he knows
where we're going?

1036
00:48:51,744 --> 00:48:53,805
He has to go to kindergarten.

1037
00:48:53,904 --> 00:48:55,538
Huh?

1038
00:48:56,805 --> 00:48:59,137
Are you kidding me?
I can't...

1039
00:48:59,544 --> 00:49:02,505
Everything is going perfect...
I just bought it.

1040
00:49:02,605 --> 00:49:04,664
Okay! Daddy's
going to use some words.

1041
00:49:04,766 --> 00:49:06,319
How about we go
to the carnival?

1042
00:49:06,405 --> 00:49:08,938
Or maybe check out
some of those shops in town?

1043
00:49:09,981 --> 00:49:11,424
What did you do?

1044
00:49:11,488 --> 00:49:14,821
We're not going anywhere.
If you get my point.

1045
00:49:14,922 --> 00:49:15,855
- Brilliant!
- That was genius!

1046
00:49:15,954 --> 00:49:16,920
Nice work, Jessie!

1047
00:49:16,956 --> 00:49:20,088
I'm sure Buzz and Woody are
on their way back right now.

1048
00:49:22,253 --> 00:49:23,321
Whoa!

1049
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:25,687
Forky is in there?

1050
00:49:25,788 --> 00:49:26,463
Yeah.

1051
00:49:26,517 --> 00:49:27,993
Now, hold on.
I have a question.

1052
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:30,799
Who will Bonnie love more?
Ducky or me? Say me.

1053
00:49:30,877 --> 00:49:31,914
- No, say Ducky. Ducky.
- Bunny. Bunny.

1054
00:49:31,950 --> 00:49:33,579
Okay, guys.
Playtime is over.

1055
00:49:33,615 --> 00:49:34,955
You have to
follow my lead.

1056
00:49:35,054 --> 00:49:37,954
We stay together, we stay quiet.
Are we clear?

1057
00:49:38,055 --> 00:49:39,888
Absolutely.
Lead the way.

1058
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:02,697
- Are you kidding me?
- Move over.

1059
00:50:02,782 --> 00:50:04,198
- You move over.
- Quit pushing me.

1060
00:50:04,269 --> 00:50:05,321
- Stop.
- Shh!

1061
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:07,799
Oh, my maker!
That sheep has three heads!

1062
00:50:07,835 --> 00:50:08,553
No, no, no!

1063
00:50:08,653 --> 00:50:11,225
What? All six eyes
just looked into my soul.

1064
00:50:11,261 --> 00:50:12,528
Gonna have nightmares.

1065
00:50:17,187 --> 00:50:20,722
That's most likely where
your Forky is being kept.

1066
00:50:20,822 --> 00:50:21,989
All right,
this isn't so bad.

1067
00:50:22,089 --> 00:50:24,054
We just can't be seen
by the dummies.

1068
00:50:24,153 --> 00:50:25,503
Not just the dummies.

1069
00:50:25,581 --> 00:50:29,089
Her cabinet is surrounded
by a moat of exposed aisle.

1070
00:50:29,188 --> 00:50:31,655
Where Dragon roams.

1071
00:50:32,415 --> 00:50:33,838
- We can handle a cat.
- No.

1072
00:50:33,899 --> 00:50:35,199
Not this one.

1073
00:50:39,069 --> 00:50:41,788
Is that how we look
on the inside?

1074
00:50:41,888 --> 00:50:43,858
- There's so much...
- fluff.

1075
00:50:43,944 --> 00:50:45,417
So, how do you propose
we get up there?

1076
00:50:45,487 --> 00:50:47,545
We could go straight across.

1077
00:50:47,631 --> 00:50:49,413
How?
That's quite a jump.

1078
00:50:49,449 --> 00:50:51,451
We know the perfect toy
to help.

1079
00:50:51,487 --> 00:50:52,654
Oh, Bonnie, check it out.

1080
00:50:52,754 --> 00:50:54,821
- Look at all this cool stuff.
- Bonnie?

1081
00:50:54,922 --> 00:50:56,391
We gotta get
Forky now!

1082
00:50:56,427 --> 00:50:57,785
Woody, don't...

1083
00:50:57,821 --> 00:50:59,123
- Stick to the plan.
- 10-4.

1084
00:50:59,159 --> 00:51:01,093
- Follow me.
- Roger that.

1085
00:51:06,421 --> 00:51:08,788
Woody just sits in the closet?
With no playtime?

1086
00:51:08,888 --> 00:51:11,063
Yeah, he told me himself,
he's useless.

1087
00:51:11,141 --> 00:51:12,225
That's awful.

1088
00:51:12,303 --> 00:51:14,288
Such pretty hair...

1089
00:51:14,387 --> 00:51:15,687
What are you doing?

1090
00:51:15,787 --> 00:51:16,821
You need to stick
to the plan.

1091
00:51:16,922 --> 00:51:18,360
But it's Bonnie.
She's right...

1092
00:51:18,438 --> 00:51:20,188
Can we go
to the carnival, too?

1093
00:51:20,287 --> 00:51:21,221
...there.

1094
00:51:21,321 --> 00:51:23,188
Come on. Stay quiet.

1095
00:51:23,288 --> 00:51:24,955
You better hope
the dummies didn't...

1096
00:51:28,754 --> 00:51:30,021
Whoa!

1097
00:52:03,194 --> 00:52:04,829
My sheep!

1098
00:52:12,287 --> 00:52:14,480
What did I say?
I lead. You follow.

1099
00:52:14,628 --> 00:52:16,228
Bo, I'm so sorry. Really.

1100
00:52:16,291 --> 00:52:17,366
Just tell me how to help.

1101
00:52:17,402 --> 00:52:18,418
You really wanna help?

1102
00:52:18,504 --> 00:52:21,097
Then stay out of my way.
I'm getting my sheep back.

1103
00:52:21,195 --> 00:52:22,196
What about the others?

1104
00:52:22,295 --> 00:52:24,062
Giggle knows what to do.

1105
00:52:26,628 --> 00:52:28,996
- Here you go.
- That's our objective.

1106
00:52:29,097 --> 00:52:31,030
We have to get that key.

1107
00:52:31,130 --> 00:52:32,495
It's the only way
inside the cabinet.

1108
00:52:32,595 --> 00:52:33,962
You can't be serious.

1109
00:52:34,063 --> 00:52:35,363
How are we supposed
to do that?

1110
00:52:35,463 --> 00:52:36,453
Okay.

1111
00:52:36,523 --> 00:52:37,997
You know what,
leave that to us.

1112
00:52:38,097 --> 00:52:39,263
We know exactly
what to do.

1113
00:52:39,363 --> 00:52:40,130
Mmm-hmm.

1114
00:52:42,362 --> 00:52:43,029
Aw.

1115
00:52:43,130 --> 00:52:45,163
Where did you
two come from?

1116
00:52:45,263 --> 00:52:47,396
The keys! Give 'em up now!
Where are they?

1117
00:52:47,495 --> 00:52:49,796
Give us the keys!
Give us the keys!

1118
00:52:49,897 --> 00:52:50,963
Well, we're not doing that.

1119
00:52:51,062 --> 00:52:52,263
Yeah, yeah, I agree,
too visible.

1120
00:52:52,363 --> 00:52:53,530
It's a good point.
Something more subtle.

1121
00:52:53,630 --> 00:52:55,305
Ooh, what about "Winner,
winner, chicken dinner"?

1122
00:52:55,376 --> 00:52:56,229
Yes.

1123
00:53:02,261 --> 00:53:04,730
The keys! Give 'em up now!
Where are they?

1124
00:53:04,766 --> 00:53:06,963
- Uh... you're kidding.
- Really?

1125
00:53:07,063 --> 00:53:08,563
Okay, okay.
You just...

1126
00:53:08,662 --> 00:53:09,813
All right. Well...

1127
00:53:09,849 --> 00:53:12,029
Oh, what about the old
"Plush Rush"?

1128
00:53:12,129 --> 00:53:13,163
There you go!

1129
00:53:26,053 --> 00:53:28,526
- Argh. Where is this going?
- Shh! Don't interrupt.

1130
00:53:44,050 --> 00:53:44,962
- Okay, right?
- Uh-huh?

1131
00:53:45,063 --> 00:53:47,096
Not gonna happen.
N-O.

1132
00:53:47,196 --> 00:53:48,963
Okay, do you want
the key or not?

1133
00:53:49,062 --> 00:53:50,129
What is
wrong with you?

1134
00:53:50,229 --> 00:53:50,985
What is wrong with...?

1135
00:53:51,021 --> 00:53:53,263
We just gave you
three brilliant ideas.

1136
00:53:53,362 --> 00:53:54,583
It's one thing
to say no.

1137
00:53:54,669 --> 00:53:56,529
It's another to offer
a reason...

1138
00:53:56,629 --> 00:53:58,362
How do we get that key?

1139
00:54:04,329 --> 00:54:05,963
You're kidding!

1140
00:54:06,061 --> 00:54:07,328
Really?

1141
00:54:07,429 --> 00:54:08,496
Woody's back?

1142
00:54:08,595 --> 00:54:09,762
Woody's back?

1143
00:54:09,798 --> 00:54:11,713
And you're sure it's
Bo Peep who's with him?

1144
00:54:13,195 --> 00:54:14,228
Thank you, Benson.

1145
00:54:14,328 --> 00:54:16,062
Make sure the others
are ready.

1146
00:54:17,528 --> 00:54:18,830
Woody's back!

1147
00:54:18,929 --> 00:54:21,062
I'm coming, Bonnie!

1148
00:54:21,863 --> 00:54:22,963
Bonnie.

1149
00:54:23,062 --> 00:54:24,997
First, we must prepare
for his arrival.

1150
00:54:25,096 --> 00:54:25,770
Prepare?

1151
00:54:25,848 --> 00:54:27,723
Have you ever played
hide-and-seek?

1152
00:54:27,817 --> 00:54:29,924
No. But it sounds complicated.

1153
00:54:30,026 --> 00:54:30,962
Oh, it's easy.

1154
00:54:31,061 --> 00:54:32,328
- I'll teach you, okay?
- Okay.

1155
00:54:32,428 --> 00:54:34,459
The first thing
you do is...

1156
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:36,388
one of us finds
a place to hide...

1157
00:54:36,459 --> 00:54:36,978
Scary.

1158
00:54:37,014 --> 00:54:38,949
...while
the other one counts to ten...

1159
00:54:39,025 --> 00:54:40,753
then tries to find them.

1160
00:54:58,713 --> 00:55:00,096
- What are we doing?
- Shh!

1161
00:55:00,288 --> 00:55:03,188
Just stand there
and be quiet!

1162
00:55:07,962 --> 00:55:09,829
I'll do the talking.

1163
00:55:11,061 --> 00:55:12,829
Hi, Tinny!

1164
00:55:12,930 --> 00:55:14,496
Aw, nice to
see you, too.

1165
00:55:15,930 --> 00:55:17,830
Yeah, he's with me.

1166
00:55:17,930 --> 00:55:19,395
My friend?
No, no, no.

1167
00:55:19,495 --> 00:55:21,229
He's my accessory.

1168
00:55:21,328 --> 00:55:23,162
- Hey, guys.
- Bo!

1169
00:55:23,263 --> 00:55:25,329
Long time no see.

1170
00:55:25,429 --> 00:55:27,100
Couldn't take it
out there, huh?

1171
00:55:27,147 --> 00:55:28,732
Hey, Doug.
Saw your better half

1172
00:55:28,768 --> 00:55:29,930
at the front
of the store.

1173
00:55:30,029 --> 00:55:31,996
Yeah, you mess with the cat,
you get the claws.

1174
00:55:32,096 --> 00:55:33,062
Bo came back!

1175
00:55:33,162 --> 00:55:34,363
Magic 8-Ball was right!

1176
00:55:34,462 --> 00:55:36,597
- Excuse me. Sorry.
- What are you doing here?

1177
00:55:36,659 --> 00:55:38,831
I thought the store
had no return policy!

1178
00:55:38,870 --> 00:55:39,983
Bo, help me out.

1179
00:55:40,084 --> 00:55:41,571
I need a battery.

1180
00:55:41,665 --> 00:55:44,199
<i>We got to get
this wagon train a-movin'!</i>

1181
00:55:44,285 --> 00:55:45,810
- Agreed.
- Help, help, help.

1182
00:55:45,846 --> 00:55:46,785
Cheater.

1183
00:55:46,856 --> 00:55:48,026
Have you seen Duke?

1184
00:55:48,062 --> 00:55:49,363
He's in the back.

1185
00:55:57,695 --> 00:55:59,563
Look who jumped
40 school buses

1186
00:55:59,663 --> 00:56:01,191
and landed back
into my life.

1187
00:56:01,277 --> 00:56:03,295
- Hi, Duke!
- Who's the cowboy?

1188
00:56:03,396 --> 00:56:05,244
Duke, meet Woody.
Woody, meet...

1189
00:56:05,322 --> 00:56:08,009
Duke Caboom.
Canada's greatest stuntman.

1190
00:56:08,045 --> 00:56:10,295
Oh, yeah!

1191
00:56:11,261 --> 00:56:12,329
- Yes!
- Huh?

1192
00:56:12,429 --> 00:56:13,862
He's posing.

1193
00:56:14,595 --> 00:56:15,619
Duke?

1194
00:56:15,705 --> 00:56:17,663
- Duke, we need to...
- Hold on. One more.

1195
00:56:17,762 --> 00:56:20,229
Oh, yeah!
What brings you back, Peep?

1196
00:56:20,328 --> 00:56:21,496
We need your help.

1197
00:56:21,595 --> 00:56:24,562
Gabby Gabby has his toy
and my sheep.

1198
00:56:24,663 --> 00:56:28,396
No. Billy, Goat, and Gruff?
Those are my girls.

1199
00:56:28,496 --> 00:56:29,810
What were you doing
getting tangled up

1200
00:56:29,846 --> 00:56:31,495
with Gabby Gabby?
You know better.

1201
00:56:31,596 --> 00:56:34,007
Yeah, some toy thought
it would be a good idea...

1202
00:56:34,069 --> 00:56:35,362
to wander into the aisle.

1203
00:56:35,462 --> 00:56:36,796
That doesn't make any sense.

1204
00:56:36,896 --> 00:56:37,960
It doesn't, does it?

1205
00:56:38,038 --> 00:56:40,495
Everybody knows the best route
is behind the shelves.

1206
00:56:40,596 --> 00:56:42,729
That would have been
a better route, wouldn't it?

1207
00:56:42,828 --> 00:56:44,830
Wow, this toy sounds like
a complete idiot.

1208
00:56:44,929 --> 00:56:46,496
He does!

1209
00:56:46,596 --> 00:56:48,862
Wait, are you that toy?

1210
00:56:48,963 --> 00:56:50,596
So, here's the plan.

1211
00:56:50,695 --> 00:56:53,228
We need to jump over the
aisle to Gabby's cabinet.

1212
00:56:53,328 --> 00:56:56,096
- And you are the toy to do it.
- No.

1213
00:56:56,196 --> 00:56:57,056
- Duke.
- Nope.

1214
00:56:57,092 --> 00:56:58,529
- Duke? Duke?
- Nuh-uh. No way!

1215
00:56:58,629 --> 00:57:00,262
- Duke. Duke!
- Pass. Negative.

1216
00:57:00,361 --> 00:57:01,289
- Duke.
- Rejected.

1217
00:57:01,325 --> 00:57:03,526
Oh, please, Mr. Caboom,
this is really important.

1218
00:57:03,562 --> 00:57:04,663
My kid...

1219
00:57:04,762 --> 00:57:05,662
You have a kid?

1220
00:57:05,763 --> 00:57:07,329
Uh...

1221
00:57:07,428 --> 00:57:10,129
Hey, Duke, show us some more
poses, what do you say?

1222
00:57:10,229 --> 00:57:12,262
- I had a kid.
- Oh, no.

1223
00:57:12,361 --> 00:57:13,663
Rejean.

1224
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:17,563
Rejean was so excited when
he got me after Christmas.

1225
00:57:17,663 --> 00:57:21,428
<i>It was the happiest Boxing Day
of my life.</i>

1226
00:57:21,528 --> 00:57:22,795
<i>That's Duke Caboom,</i>

1227
00:57:22,895 --> 00:57:25,562
<i>riding the amazing
Caboom stunt cycle!</i>

1228
00:57:25,662 --> 00:57:27,328
<i>Caboom!</i>

1229
00:57:27,428 --> 00:57:30,762
<i>I was ready to finally
do what I was made to do.</i>

1230
00:57:30,863 --> 00:57:32,196
<i>Caboom!</i>

1231
00:57:32,296 --> 00:57:34,130
<i>But when Rejean realized
I couldn't jump</i>

1232
00:57:34,229 --> 00:57:36,097
<i>as far as the toy
in the commercial...</i>

1233
00:57:37,099 --> 00:57:40,261
It's a commercial!
It's not real!

1234
00:57:40,362 --> 00:57:41,796
Rejean threw me away!

1235
00:57:41,896 --> 00:57:43,098
It's not fair!

1236
00:57:43,192 --> 00:57:45,261
Why, Rejean? Why?

1237
00:57:46,628 --> 00:57:50,129
Okay, okay.
Calm down, Duke.

1238
00:57:50,229 --> 00:57:52,196
That was a long time ago.

1239
00:57:52,296 --> 00:57:53,762
Right now,
we need the only toy

1240
00:57:53,862 --> 00:57:56,817
who can crash us
onto Gabby's cabinet.

1241
00:57:56,911 --> 00:57:57,662
Crash?

1242
00:57:57,762 --> 00:57:58,577
Crash?

1243
00:57:58,639 --> 00:58:00,890
Any Duke Caboom toy
can land...

1244
00:58:00,970 --> 00:58:04,796
but you are the only one
that can crash the way you do.

1245
00:58:04,896 --> 00:58:06,396
- I am?
- Yes!

1246
00:58:06,496 --> 00:58:08,696
Forget Rejean.
Forget your commercial.

1247
00:58:08,796 --> 00:58:11,296
Be the Duke
you are right now...

1248
00:58:11,395 --> 00:58:14,528
the one who jumps
and crashes!

1249
00:58:16,895 --> 00:58:22,328
Be who I am right now.

1250
00:58:22,429 --> 00:58:24,629
Who's the Canuck
with all the luck?

1251
00:58:25,361 --> 00:58:26,293
Caboom?

1252
00:58:26,379 --> 00:58:28,495
Who's the greatest
of the Great White North?

1253
00:58:28,595 --> 00:58:29,215
Caboom!

1254
00:58:29,286 --> 00:58:31,210
Who's the most
spectacular daredevil

1255
00:58:31,246 --> 00:58:32,695
Canada has ever seen?

1256
00:58:32,796 --> 00:58:34,462
Duke Caboom!

1257
00:58:34,562 --> 00:58:35,795
Can you do the jump?

1258
00:58:35,896 --> 00:58:37,863
Yes, I Canada!

1259
00:58:39,829 --> 00:58:41,529
Uh-huh.

1260
00:58:41,629 --> 00:58:44,129
- We've got our ride.
- Yes!

1261
00:58:44,228 --> 00:58:45,662
<i>Yee-haw!</i>

1262
00:58:46,295 --> 00:58:47,362
Yo, Bo!

1263
00:58:47,462 --> 00:58:49,663
Gigs! You made it!

1264
00:58:49,813 --> 00:58:50,880
Good work!

1265
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:52,445
How'd you get it?

1266
00:58:52,545 --> 00:58:54,512
How do we get that key?

1267
00:58:59,844 --> 00:59:01,794
- It was hard.
- Very difficult.

1268
00:59:01,864 --> 00:59:03,450
- Barely made it out alive.
- Yeah.

1269
00:59:03,528 --> 00:59:04,412
So, you're welcome.

1270
00:59:04,511 --> 00:59:07,311
Okay. Let's do this.

1271
00:59:07,412 --> 00:59:09,178
Let me wrap that up for you.

1272
00:59:09,278 --> 00:59:11,934
Don't want anything to happen
to it on the way home.

1273
00:59:11,989 --> 00:59:14,445
Good. That sale
buys us some time.

1274
00:59:15,255 --> 00:59:17,382
Wait for it.

1275
00:59:18,845 --> 00:59:20,646
All right, let's go!

1276
01:00:01,844 --> 01:00:04,311
So, how long
were you in here?

1277
01:00:04,411 --> 01:00:06,145
I don't know.
Couple years.

1278
01:00:06,246 --> 01:00:09,246
I didn't wanna sit on a shelf
waiting for my life to happen.

1279
01:00:09,345 --> 01:00:10,707
So, I left.

1280
01:00:10,763 --> 01:00:11,805
Wow.

1281
01:00:11,883 --> 01:00:14,345
You've handled this lost toy
life better than I could.

1282
01:00:14,445 --> 01:00:16,226
Aw, Sheriff.

1283
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:18,010
You're selling
yourself short.

1284
01:00:19,905 --> 01:00:22,605
I think you'd make
a great lost toy.

1285
01:00:23,545 --> 01:00:24,712
You really don't think

1286
01:00:24,812 --> 01:00:27,051
you'll ever be in
a kid's room again, huh?

1287
01:00:27,125 --> 01:00:28,037
Nope.

1288
01:00:28,108 --> 01:00:29,342
And now with the carnival
traveling through,

1289
01:00:29,430 --> 01:00:30,741
it's our chance
to hop a ride...

1290
01:00:30,777 --> 01:00:33,072
- and leave town.
- You're leaving?

1291
01:00:33,108 --> 01:00:33,944
Sure am.

1292
01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:36,402
You ever think about getting
out there, seeing the world?

1293
01:00:36,491 --> 01:00:38,095
Without a kid?

1294
01:00:38,131 --> 01:00:40,886
No. You can't teach
this old toy new tricks.

1295
01:00:40,949 --> 01:00:43,743
You'd be surprised.

1296
01:00:43,845 --> 01:00:47,724
So, how'd you end up in this
store in the first place?

1297
01:00:47,794 --> 01:00:50,141
Well, I saw your lamp
in the window...

1298
01:00:50,195 --> 01:00:54,014
and I thought maybe
you were inside...

1299
01:00:54,061 --> 01:00:55,878
and so I, uh...

1300
01:00:59,655 --> 01:01:00,755
Wow.

1301
01:01:01,911 --> 01:01:03,578
Yeah.

1302
01:01:03,679 --> 01:01:05,113
Will you look at that?

1303
01:01:06,635 --> 01:01:09,769
This is the only part
of the store I ever liked.

1304
01:01:17,511 --> 01:01:20,878
That's gonna be quite a
jump for you and Duke.

1305
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:23,612
For me?

1306
01:01:27,778 --> 01:01:29,601
Didn't I tell you?
You're going with him.

1307
01:01:29,695 --> 01:01:30,646
I am?

1308
01:01:31,512 --> 01:01:32,612
Let's caboom.

1309
01:01:32,712 --> 01:01:34,378
It'll be fine,
Duke's the best.

1310
01:01:34,478 --> 01:01:35,912
Yeah, at crashing.

1311
01:01:40,011 --> 01:01:41,345
And now!

1312
01:01:43,578 --> 01:01:44,578
Go!

1313
01:01:44,678 --> 01:01:45,612
Whoa!

1314
01:01:53,112 --> 01:01:54,913
Huh? Rejean.

1315
01:01:55,012 --> 01:01:57,745
<i>It's a commercial.
It's not real!</i>

1316
01:01:57,846 --> 01:02:00,346
I can't do this!
I'm sorry, Rejean!

1317
01:02:00,445 --> 01:02:01,879
No, no, no!

1318
01:02:10,612 --> 01:02:12,646
What's new, pussycat?

1319
01:02:23,177 --> 01:02:24,745
- Forky?
- Girls?

1320
01:02:24,845 --> 01:02:26,668
Forky, where are you?

1321
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:28,486
You're never
gonna find me.

1322
01:02:28,586 --> 01:02:30,553
Forky?

1323
01:02:30,653 --> 01:02:32,978
Woody!
How'd you find me?

1324
01:02:33,033 --> 01:02:34,721
- Bo, I found him!
- Hi.

1325
01:02:34,821 --> 01:02:37,736
Wait, it's an actual fork?

1326
01:02:37,814 --> 01:02:39,107
Bo! Bo! Bo!

1327
01:02:39,171 --> 01:02:40,871
Buzz!
The dummies are gone!

1328
01:02:40,970 --> 01:02:43,003
What?
Where'd they go?

1329
01:02:45,237 --> 01:02:46,024
Okay, we can go now!

1330
01:02:46,060 --> 01:02:48,870
- No. I need to find my girls.
- Hello, Woody.

1331
01:02:48,971 --> 01:02:49,904
Hi, Bo.

1332
01:02:50,003 --> 01:02:51,127
- Where are my sheep?
- Yeah!

1333
01:02:51,197 --> 01:02:52,803
Look! Woody found me!

1334
01:02:52,904 --> 01:02:54,970
- Take the bunny!
- I'm too cute to die!

1335
01:02:57,037 --> 01:02:58,704
- Hi-ya!
- Oh, no, no!

1336
01:02:58,803 --> 01:03:00,138
Woody!

1337
01:03:00,236 --> 01:03:03,171
- I just wanna talk.
- Yeah, with my voice box!

1338
01:03:04,602 --> 01:03:05,937
Pull!

1339
01:03:06,037 --> 01:03:07,470
Whoa!

1340
01:03:07,570 --> 01:03:10,070
<i>You're my favorite deputy.</i>

1341
01:03:11,571 --> 01:03:13,227
<i>Somebody's poisoned
the water hole.</i>

1342
01:03:13,305 --> 01:03:14,838
<i>I'd like to join your posse.</i>

1343
01:03:14,938 --> 01:03:17,138
<i>Reach for the sky!</i>

1344
01:03:28,670 --> 01:03:30,104
Girls!

1345
01:03:30,203 --> 01:03:31,703
Drop it.

1346
01:03:35,237 --> 01:03:36,838
No! No! Forky!

1347
01:03:36,937 --> 01:03:38,870
- We've gotta go!
- Wait!

1348
01:03:38,970 --> 01:03:40,671
Forky!

1349
01:03:43,104 --> 01:03:44,104
Woody!

1350
01:03:57,603 --> 01:03:58,671
Bonnie's backpack?

1351
01:04:01,969 --> 01:04:03,037
Ahh!

1352
01:04:05,836 --> 01:04:07,169
Giggle!

1353
01:04:08,971 --> 01:04:10,771
Don't let Woody leave!

1354
01:04:13,569 --> 01:04:14,736
Grab on!

1355
01:04:19,202 --> 01:04:20,923
Duke, get us out of here!

1356
01:04:21,001 --> 01:04:21,938
<i>Oui!</i>

1357
01:04:22,803 --> 01:04:24,636
Here, kitty, kitty!

1358
01:04:24,737 --> 01:04:26,537
Wait! We don't have Forky!

1359
01:04:26,636 --> 01:04:28,136
Woody!

1360
01:04:31,736 --> 01:04:32,903
Forky!

1361
01:04:52,236 --> 01:04:53,737
Is everyone okay?

1362
01:04:57,071 --> 01:04:59,470
Shh. It's okay.

1363
01:04:59,570 --> 01:05:01,503
Shh. It's okay.

1364
01:05:01,604 --> 01:05:03,737
Bunny? Bunny?

1365
01:05:03,836 --> 01:05:07,136
Bunny!
No, no, no, no.

1366
01:05:07,236 --> 01:05:11,003
No, no, no, no.

1367
01:05:11,103 --> 01:05:13,237
- Oh, Bunny!
- It's gonna be okay.

1368
01:05:13,337 --> 01:05:14,155
Forky's still in there.

1369
01:05:14,191 --> 01:05:15,904
If we hurry, we can get him
before they lock him up.

1370
01:05:16,003 --> 01:05:17,389
You want us
to go back in there?

1371
01:05:17,425 --> 01:05:18,736
We barely
got out alive.

1372
01:05:18,837 --> 01:05:19,812
Woody, it's better
if we wait.

1373
01:05:19,848 --> 01:05:22,003
No, no, no. There's no time.
We can easily get back inside.

1374
01:05:22,074 --> 01:05:22,759
But I saw Bonnie's...

1375
01:05:22,837 --> 01:05:24,061
By my count, there were
only four dummies.

1376
01:05:24,097 --> 01:05:24,837
But the backpack...

1377
01:05:24,936 --> 01:05:26,103
We outnumber them.
So we have the advantage.

1378
01:05:26,202 --> 01:05:27,890
Woody, look at us!

1379
01:05:30,836 --> 01:05:33,536
Nobody is with you.
It's over, okay?

1380
01:05:33,636 --> 01:05:36,150
No. No, no, no. We are wasting time.
We can do this.

1381
01:05:36,186 --> 01:05:38,062
- Come on, Pull-string.
- It's not worth it.

1382
01:05:38,098 --> 01:05:39,491
Yeah, yes,
listen to her!

1383
01:05:39,545 --> 01:05:41,098
- Nobody wants this!
- I do!

1384
01:05:41,134 --> 01:05:42,470
- Why?
- Because!

1385
01:05:42,506 --> 01:05:44,137
- Why?
- Just because!

1386
01:05:44,237 --> 01:05:44,971
Why?

1387
01:05:45,069 --> 01:05:47,291
Because it's all
I have left to do!

1388
01:05:49,270 --> 01:05:51,103
I don't have anything else.

1389
01:05:52,609 --> 01:05:54,141
So, the rest of us
don't count?

1390
01:05:55,310 --> 01:05:57,278
That's not what I meant.

1391
01:05:57,379 --> 01:05:58,812
Bonnie needs Forky.

1392
01:05:58,912 --> 01:06:01,419
No. You need Bonnie!

1393
01:06:01,529 --> 01:06:02,778
Open your eyes, Woody.

1394
01:06:02,879 --> 01:06:04,884
There's plenty of kids
out there.

1395
01:06:04,954 --> 01:06:08,946
It can't be just about the
one you're still clinging to.

1396
01:06:09,045 --> 01:06:10,945
It's called loyalty.

1397
01:06:11,045 --> 01:06:13,363
Something a lost toy
wouldn't understand.

1398
01:06:20,912 --> 01:06:23,077
I'm not the one who's lost.

1399
01:06:24,645 --> 01:06:26,013
Let's get out of here.

1400
01:06:26,111 --> 01:06:28,611
We've got a carnival
that leaves in the morning.

1401
01:06:28,712 --> 01:06:30,112
Come on.

1402
01:06:30,212 --> 01:06:31,312
Mmm-hmm.

1403
01:06:31,412 --> 01:06:32,779
We'll find our own kid.

1404
01:06:32,878 --> 01:06:34,211
You're crazy.

1405
01:06:37,402 --> 01:06:38,301
Bo!

1406
01:06:38,364 --> 01:06:41,311
Bye, Woody.
Good luck with Bonnie.

1407
01:06:47,194 --> 01:06:50,796
Woody, you did
all you could.

1408
01:06:50,896 --> 01:06:52,606
Time to go home.

1409
01:06:52,709 --> 01:06:53,709
No.

1410
01:06:53,864 --> 01:06:54,560
Woody.

1411
01:06:54,639 --> 01:06:56,483
I don't leave
toys behind, Buzz.

1412
01:06:56,519 --> 01:06:57,796
Yeah, but, Woody,
you're actually leaving...

1413
01:06:57,896 --> 01:06:59,896
Not now. Not ever.

1414
01:07:01,394 --> 01:07:04,062
And he left me behind.

1415
01:07:04,162 --> 01:07:06,016
What now, inner voice?

1416
01:07:06,052 --> 01:07:07,961
<i>Mission
accomplished. Return to base.</i>

1417
01:07:08,055 --> 01:07:10,333
Go back to the RV?
What about Woody?

1418
01:07:10,395 --> 01:07:12,029
<i>We're going home,
space ranger.</i>

1419
01:07:12,129 --> 01:07:13,429
<i>Fall back, this planet...</i>

1420
01:07:13,529 --> 01:07:14,509
<i>Retreat! There's too...</i>

1421
01:07:14,545 --> 01:07:16,629
<i>Go! Time to fly! Exit the...
Back... Run...</i>

1422
01:07:16,739 --> 01:07:18,462
<i>Get out!
Returning to Star Command.</i>

1423
01:07:18,562 --> 01:07:20,895
Okay. Okay.

1424
01:07:22,462 --> 01:07:25,227
Thanks a lot, inner voice.

1425
01:07:25,327 --> 01:07:29,028
Harmony, honey, help Grandma
close up for the night.

1426
01:07:29,128 --> 01:07:32,072
Okay. Then can we
go to the carnival?

1427
01:07:32,163 --> 01:07:33,296
Sure.

1428
01:07:38,129 --> 01:07:40,130
- Ahhh!
- Hello, Woody.

1429
01:07:41,495 --> 01:07:42,886
I knew you'd be back.

1430
01:07:44,078 --> 01:07:45,579
You don't know me.

1431
01:07:45,678 --> 01:07:47,411
But I do.

1432
01:07:47,511 --> 01:07:51,178
You were left in the
closet, feeling useless...

1433
01:07:51,278 --> 01:07:53,278
wondering if you'll
ever get played with.

1434
01:07:53,378 --> 01:07:55,278
I'm not leaving
without Forky.

1435
01:07:55,378 --> 01:07:57,477
Can we agree
on just one thing?

1436
01:07:58,188 --> 01:07:58,967
What?

1437
01:07:59,038 --> 01:08:01,145
That being there for a child

1438
01:08:01,246 --> 01:08:04,544
is the most noble thing
a toy can do.

1439
01:08:06,078 --> 01:08:07,278
Okay.

1440
01:08:09,344 --> 01:08:12,946
I was defective
right out of the box.

1441
01:08:13,046 --> 01:08:16,386
I can only imagine what it
must have been like for you.

1442
01:08:17,443 --> 01:08:21,011
All that time you
spent with Andy...

1443
01:08:21,112 --> 01:08:25,145
riding a bike with him
for the first time...

1444
01:08:25,246 --> 01:08:28,846
comforting him
when he skinned his knee...

1445
01:08:28,945 --> 01:08:31,945
proudly watching him
grow up.

1446
01:08:32,045 --> 01:08:35,179
And then you got a second
chance with Bonnie...

1447
01:08:35,277 --> 01:08:38,078
giving her comfort when
she's scared at school...

1448
01:08:38,178 --> 01:08:41,512
helping her when
she needs it most.

1449
01:08:41,611 --> 01:08:45,477
You've been there through
all their ups and downs.

1450
01:08:47,353 --> 01:08:48,921
Please.

1451
01:08:49,020 --> 01:08:50,253
Be honest with me.

1452
01:08:52,243 --> 01:08:55,178
Was it as wonderful
as it sounds?

1453
01:08:58,977 --> 01:09:00,144
It was.

1454
01:09:03,511 --> 01:09:08,079
All I want is a chance for
just one of those moments.

1455
01:09:10,078 --> 01:09:14,212
I'd give anything to be
loved the way you have.

1456
01:09:20,225 --> 01:09:21,757
Just leave me Forky.

1457
01:09:23,177 --> 01:09:25,111
Bonnie needs him.

1458
01:09:26,511 --> 01:09:28,278
Of course.

1459
01:09:39,210 --> 01:09:42,078
The flat tire is fixed!

1460
01:09:42,178 --> 01:09:44,079
Come on, Woody, hurry up.

1461
01:09:44,177 --> 01:09:46,344
Where is he?

1462
01:09:46,444 --> 01:09:48,277
- Buzz!
- Buzz!

1463
01:09:48,378 --> 01:09:49,946
- Where's Woody?
- And Forky?

1464
01:09:50,046 --> 01:09:50,946
We have a situation.

1465
01:09:51,024 --> 01:09:52,842
They need to be extracted
from the antique store.

1466
01:09:52,928 --> 01:09:54,029
How do we do that?

1467
01:09:54,131 --> 01:09:56,070
Okay, let's
make sure we have everything.

1468
01:09:56,145 --> 01:09:57,945
Finally.

1469
01:09:58,046 --> 01:09:59,278
It's okay.
Any minute now...

1470
01:09:59,377 --> 01:10:01,611
Bonnie will notice
her backpack is missing.

1471
01:10:01,712 --> 01:10:03,838
She'll realize she left it
at the antique store...

1472
01:10:03,909 --> 01:10:05,769
and we'll head back
in there.

1473
01:10:05,832 --> 01:10:07,460
Okay.
Looks like we have everything.

1474
01:10:07,530 --> 01:10:09,040
- You good, Bonnie?
- Yup.

1475
01:10:09,110 --> 01:10:10,478
Great. Let's get out of here.

1476
01:10:11,660 --> 01:10:13,512
Okay, genius,
what do we do now?

1477
01:10:13,612 --> 01:10:14,650
Hmm.

1478
01:10:14,751 --> 01:10:15,912
<i>Scanning perimeter.</i>

1479
01:10:16,012 --> 01:10:16,845
<i>Laser at full power!</i>

1480
01:10:16,923 --> 01:10:19,080
- Buzz, what are you doing?
- I'm thinking.

1481
01:10:19,135 --> 01:10:20,846
Honey, will you
please shut that toy off?

1482
01:10:20,945 --> 01:10:21,851
Yeah, I got it.

1483
01:10:21,887 --> 01:10:23,946
<i>Attack!
Meteor shower! Look out!</i>

1484
01:10:24,045 --> 01:10:26,622
<i>It's a secret mission in
uncharted space! Let's go!</i>

1485
01:10:26,731 --> 01:10:29,135
<i>Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!</i>

1486
01:10:29,252 --> 01:10:30,286
Bonnie, how do you
turn this off?

1487
01:10:30,387 --> 01:10:31,687
<i>Full speed ahead!</i>

1488
01:10:31,786 --> 01:10:33,353
- <i>Open the pod bay doors!</i>
- I don't know.

1489
01:10:33,453 --> 01:10:35,021
<i>It's just you and me now,
cadet.</i>

1490
01:10:35,121 --> 01:10:36,420
<i>A distress signal is coming
from that rocket.</i>

1491
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:38,021
Just toss it in the drawer.

1492
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:40,954
<i>To infinity and beyond!</i>

1493
01:10:41,487 --> 01:10:43,776
Uh-oh. Uh, your backpack's in
the antique store! Let's go!

1494
01:10:43,812 --> 01:10:45,619
Oh, no, my backpack!

1495
01:10:45,887 --> 01:10:48,186
I left my backpack
in the antique store!

1496
01:10:48,286 --> 01:10:49,553
You did?

1497
01:10:49,652 --> 01:10:52,687
All right,
let's swing by and get it.

1498
01:10:57,603 --> 01:11:00,470
Ugh! I can't believe
the nerve of that cowboy.

1499
01:11:00,569 --> 01:11:02,103
I mean, who does
he think he is?

1500
01:11:02,203 --> 01:11:03,337
Exactly!

1501
01:11:03,437 --> 01:11:05,236
He was way out of line.

1502
01:11:05,336 --> 01:11:07,104
You did the right thing
leaving him behind.

1503
01:11:08,436 --> 01:11:10,036
- Hey, Lamb Chops?
- Hmm.

1504
01:11:10,136 --> 01:11:11,704
- Coast is clear.
- Oh.

1505
01:11:17,201 --> 01:11:18,237
Head to the middle.

1506
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:19,535
When the carnival
leaves tomorrow,

1507
01:11:19,571 --> 01:11:21,170
we'll hide right there.

1508
01:11:23,270 --> 01:11:24,859
- Uh, no way!
- Stuff that.

1509
01:11:24,895 --> 01:11:25,596
Awesome.

1510
01:11:25,635 --> 01:11:27,070
Stick with me.
You'll be fine.

1511
01:11:27,170 --> 01:11:27,872
- Ready?
- No!

1512
01:11:27,908 --> 01:11:28,853
And another thing,

1513
01:11:28,931 --> 01:11:30,741
- Woody asked you for help.
- On your mark...

1514
01:11:30,777 --> 01:11:32,006
And he
treats you like that?

1515
01:11:32,042 --> 01:11:34,104
- ...get set...
- He only cares about himself.

1516
01:11:34,202 --> 01:11:35,203
No!

1517
01:11:35,302 --> 01:11:36,204
You're wrong.

1518
01:11:36,282 --> 01:11:38,236
Woody's always trying to
do right by his kid.

1519
01:11:38,335 --> 01:11:39,888
By putting
everyone in danger.

1520
01:11:39,951 --> 01:11:42,636
Ugh. That kind of crazy
loyalty just...

1521
01:11:42,737 --> 01:11:44,171
You gotta love him for it.

1522
01:11:44,270 --> 01:11:45,637
Whoa, say what now?

1523
01:11:45,737 --> 01:11:48,103
Hey, hey, hey, Bo!
What's the plan?

1524
01:11:48,181 --> 01:11:49,253
Fill me in here.

1525
01:11:54,769 --> 01:11:56,409
Get in! We're going back.

1526
01:11:56,445 --> 01:11:57,318
We just got here.

1527
01:11:57,354 --> 01:11:59,170
You heard Bo!
We're going back!

1528
01:11:59,269 --> 01:12:01,436
Move your plush!
Let's ride!

1529
01:12:08,169 --> 01:12:09,737
<i>You're my favorite...</i>

1530
01:12:23,437 --> 01:12:24,670
Yay!

1531
01:12:26,235 --> 01:12:27,875
<i>You are my best friend.</i>

1532
01:12:27,945 --> 01:12:29,275
<i>Let's play all day!</i>

1533
01:12:29,311 --> 01:12:31,353
Oh, Benson!
Did you hear that?

1534
01:12:31,389 --> 01:12:32,814
Isn't that lovely?

1535
01:12:32,877 --> 01:12:33,870
<i>Time for tea.</i>

1536
01:12:33,948 --> 01:12:36,037
Oh, thank you, Woody.
Thank you!

1537
01:12:36,135 --> 01:12:37,302
All my dreams

1538
01:12:37,402 --> 01:12:38,602
are coming true
because of you.

1539
01:12:38,703 --> 01:12:39,704
Thank you! Thank you!

1540
01:12:39,804 --> 01:12:41,004
Uh, you're welcome.

1541
01:12:42,203 --> 01:12:44,569
It's time, Benson.

1542
01:12:44,670 --> 01:12:47,535
Goodbye, Forky.
I'm going to miss our talks.

1543
01:12:47,613 --> 01:12:50,216
Me, too.
Good luck, Gabby.

1544
01:12:50,302 --> 01:12:52,136
Thank you,
my little utensil.

1545
01:12:53,236 --> 01:12:56,203
Bye, Gabby!
Goodbye, Benson!

1546
01:12:56,873 --> 01:12:59,135
He is terrifying.

1547
01:13:00,369 --> 01:13:01,670
- Hello.
- Hi.

1548
01:13:01,770 --> 01:13:03,037
Bonnie?

1549
01:13:03,135 --> 01:13:04,270
Can I help you
with anything?

1550
01:13:04,370 --> 01:13:05,537
Yeah. We called
about the backpack.

1551
01:13:05,636 --> 01:13:07,569
Oh, yes.
I couldn't find it.

1552
01:13:07,670 --> 01:13:08,935
Feel free to look around.

1553
01:13:09,005 --> 01:13:11,569
Quick! Before she finds it!

1554
01:13:14,070 --> 01:13:16,236
Look! There's Harmony.

1555
01:13:19,070 --> 01:13:20,704
<i>You make me so happy!</i>

1556
01:13:20,804 --> 01:13:22,203
<i>Let's be best friends.</i>

1557
01:13:23,036 --> 01:13:24,603
Oh, this is it!

1558
01:13:24,702 --> 01:13:26,402
We're going home, Forky!

1559
01:13:27,069 --> 01:13:28,235
Huh?

1560
01:13:29,068 --> 01:13:31,536
Forky! Oh!

1561
01:13:31,793 --> 01:13:34,459
No, no, no. Woody, look!
It's really happening!

1562
01:13:40,605 --> 01:13:43,405
<i>I'm Gabby Gabby,
and I love you.</i>

1563
01:13:44,627 --> 01:13:46,560
I'm gonna cry.

1564
01:13:50,585 --> 01:13:51,960
Oh, what have you
got there?

1565
01:13:52,062 --> 01:13:54,553
I found this old doll.

1566
01:13:54,653 --> 01:13:56,887
You can take it
home if you want.

1567
01:13:58,752 --> 01:13:59,820
Nah.

1568
01:14:07,519 --> 01:14:10,252
What happened? Gabby was
supposed to be her toy.

1569
01:14:10,307 --> 01:14:11,786
There's my backpack!

1570
01:14:11,886 --> 01:14:13,202
Mom, it's over here.

1571
01:14:18,218 --> 01:14:19,385
Forky!

1572
01:14:19,485 --> 01:14:20,853
Mom, I found him!

1573
01:14:20,953 --> 01:14:22,853
Oh, there he is!

1574
01:14:22,954 --> 01:14:24,420
Now, please leave him
in there,

1575
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:25,956
so he doesn't get lost again.

1576
01:14:33,252 --> 01:14:34,553
But what about Gabby?

1577
01:14:35,853 --> 01:14:37,787
Forky, listen to me
very carefully.

1578
01:14:37,886 --> 01:14:38,985
This is important.

1579
01:14:39,087 --> 01:14:41,900
Tell Buzz to get the RV
to the merry-go-round.

1580
01:14:41,962 --> 01:14:42,653
You understand?

1581
01:14:42,752 --> 01:14:45,026
Absolutely.
What is a merry-go-round?

1582
01:14:45,073 --> 01:14:47,620
The spinny ride
with lights and horses.

1583
01:14:47,720 --> 01:14:49,653
- Oh. You mean a carousel.
- Yes!

1584
01:14:49,753 --> 01:14:51,848
Carousel. Yes!
Meet me at the carousel.

1585
01:14:51,911 --> 01:14:52,652
Got it.

1586
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:08,753
Gabby! Hey, Gabby!

1587
01:15:08,852 --> 01:15:11,486
You can have
your voice box back.

1588
01:15:13,185 --> 01:15:14,886
I don't need it anymore.

1589
01:15:14,987 --> 01:15:16,286
Oh, yes, you do.

1590
01:15:16,386 --> 01:15:18,025
Harmony wasn't
your only chance, Gabby,

1591
01:15:18,061 --> 01:15:19,415
but we have to hurry.
Come on.

1592
01:15:19,509 --> 01:15:22,973
No. Harmony
was my chance.

1593
01:15:23,452 --> 01:15:25,720
My time's over.

1594
01:15:25,820 --> 01:15:27,720
Now, please go away.

1595
01:15:39,451 --> 01:15:40,854
You hear that?

1596
01:15:47,451 --> 01:15:49,420
A friend
once told me...

1597
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:51,887
"There are plenty of kids
out there."

1598
01:15:53,185 --> 01:15:55,686
And one of them
is named Bonnie.

1599
01:15:57,418 --> 01:15:59,853
She's waiting for you,
right now.

1600
01:16:01,319 --> 01:16:03,353
She just doesn't
know it yet.

1601
01:16:05,553 --> 01:16:08,286
What if you're wrong?

1602
01:16:08,346 --> 01:16:11,778
Well, if you sit on a shelf
the rest of your life...

1603
01:16:11,842 --> 01:16:13,909
you'll never find out,
will you?

1604
01:16:17,419 --> 01:16:19,453
He's right.

1605
01:16:19,552 --> 01:16:21,553
I learned that
from the best.

1606
01:16:25,719 --> 01:16:27,853
Come on, Gabby.

1607
01:16:27,954 --> 01:16:29,686
Let's get you to Bonnie.

1608
01:16:36,352 --> 01:16:37,405
The carousel?

1609
01:16:37,491 --> 01:16:40,186
Yeah, it's the spinny ride
with lights and horses.

1610
01:16:40,286 --> 01:16:42,009
Woody said
to meet him there.

1611
01:16:42,103 --> 01:16:43,820
- You gotta be kidding!
- How do we do that?

1612
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:44,793
Oh! We could, uh...

1613
01:16:44,829 --> 01:16:46,470
We are not
sending Dad to jail.

1614
01:16:46,506 --> 01:16:47,573
You're no fun.

1615
01:16:47,681 --> 01:16:50,599
<i>Left turn in 0.5 miles.</i>

1616
01:16:50,724 --> 01:16:53,680
Wait a second.
I have an idea.

1617
01:17:04,670 --> 01:17:05,837
Skunk!

1618
01:17:05,962 --> 01:17:06,929
Skunk!

1619
01:17:17,285 --> 01:17:19,910
Too many people.
Gonna need an alternate route.

1620
01:17:19,980 --> 01:17:22,041
Will we make it to
the carousel in time?

1621
01:17:25,735 --> 01:17:28,004
Yes, we Canada!

1622
01:17:28,103 --> 01:17:29,669
What? What is it?

1623
01:17:35,497 --> 01:17:38,765
Recalculating.
Take a right.

1624
01:17:38,842 --> 01:17:40,099
What? A right?

1625
01:17:40,135 --> 01:17:41,736
Right turn ahead.

1626
01:17:41,836 --> 01:17:43,782
Huh. Does
the GPS sound funny to you?

1627
01:17:43,868 --> 01:17:45,645
Honey,
it's fine. Just drive.

1628
01:17:45,681 --> 01:17:47,681
Hmm,
I thought it sounded funny.

1629
01:17:50,468 --> 01:17:51,602
Another right!

1630
01:17:51,703 --> 01:17:53,603
- Right.
- Take another right.

1631
01:17:53,702 --> 01:17:55,402
Huh?
Another right? Really?

1632
01:17:55,503 --> 01:17:56,570
- Turn right!
- Now!

1633
01:17:56,669 --> 01:17:57,936
Turn right!

1634
01:17:59,677 --> 01:18:01,778
- We're headin' back.
- There's the carousel!

1635
01:18:01,877 --> 01:18:04,677
Do you think Woody
will get there in time?

1636
01:18:04,778 --> 01:18:07,521
Nope. Forget it. Never.
No. No way. Declined.

1637
01:18:07,607 --> 01:18:09,352
- No dice. Rejected.
- Duke, Duke, you got this.

1638
01:18:09,399 --> 01:18:11,229
This is the fastest way
to the carousel.

1639
01:18:11,307 --> 01:18:12,578
You made the last jump.

1640
01:18:12,678 --> 01:18:14,763
Yeah, but that was 4 feet.
This is 40!

1641
01:18:14,857 --> 01:18:18,178
Exactly! Duke Caboom
would never repeat a stunt.

1642
01:18:18,224 --> 01:18:20,151
- No. He'd never do that.
- No, no, no.

1643
01:18:20,187 --> 01:18:23,011
He's the toy that went
on to crash 40 feet

1644
01:18:23,111 --> 01:18:25,410
into that target!

1645
01:18:25,510 --> 01:18:27,511
Yeah, he is.

1646
01:18:27,610 --> 01:18:29,078
I'm Duke Caboom!

1647
01:18:29,178 --> 01:18:31,012
Oh, man. I can do this!

1648
01:18:31,111 --> 01:18:32,444
Yes, you Canada!

1649
01:18:32,545 --> 01:18:33,913
I can do it
with my eyes closed.

1650
01:18:33,975 --> 01:18:34,650
Yes, you... What?

1651
01:18:34,686 --> 01:18:36,610
- Three, two, one. Go!
- What? No, wait!

1652
01:18:42,443 --> 01:18:44,044
- What is he doing?
- Oh, no.

1653
01:18:54,711 --> 01:18:57,012
This is for you, Rejean.

1654
01:19:02,610 --> 01:19:03,877
Caboom.

1655
01:19:07,129 --> 01:19:08,030
Yes!

1656
01:19:08,066 --> 01:19:09,577
He did it!

1657
01:19:09,613 --> 01:19:10,617
All right, our turn!

1658
01:19:10,682 --> 01:19:12,812
You heard the sheriff.
Let's go.

1659
01:19:19,012 --> 01:19:20,013
Yee-haw!

1660
01:19:22,736 --> 01:19:24,036
Another right!

1661
01:19:24,137 --> 01:19:26,033
Another right?
That's the wrong way.

1662
01:19:26,119 --> 01:19:28,013
- Are you sure?
- Stupid rental.

1663
01:19:28,091 --> 01:19:29,503
- I'm turning us around.
- No!

1664
01:19:29,602 --> 01:19:31,069
- Huh?
- Recalculating.

1665
01:19:31,170 --> 01:19:32,236
Turn right.

1666
01:19:32,335 --> 01:19:34,869
- Must be broken.
- No! No!

1667
01:19:38,935 --> 01:19:40,036
What is happening?

1668
01:19:40,136 --> 01:19:41,503
Honey, what are you doing?
Slow down!

1669
01:19:41,602 --> 01:19:42,970
I can't! I can't!

1670
01:19:43,070 --> 01:19:45,470
- Press the brake. Press it!
- I'm trying.

1671
01:19:51,735 --> 01:19:53,036
Got a visual
on the RV,

1672
01:19:53,136 --> 01:19:55,235
heading southbound.

1673
01:20:00,636 --> 01:20:01,802
Gabby?

1674
01:20:04,169 --> 01:20:05,170
Gabby?

1675
01:20:09,136 --> 01:20:10,770
I think she's lost.

1676
01:20:26,103 --> 01:20:27,703
Are you sure?

1677
01:20:38,602 --> 01:20:39,969
Change of plans.

1678
01:20:45,003 --> 01:20:47,169
<i>Pull over.</i>

1679
01:20:47,268 --> 01:20:49,102
I can't! This is a rental!

1680
01:20:49,202 --> 01:20:50,770
I don't know
what's happening!

1681
01:21:01,235 --> 01:21:03,102
I'm so nervous.

1682
01:21:03,202 --> 01:21:05,536
- What if she doesn't like me?
- Gabby.

1683
01:21:05,635 --> 01:21:06,770
I don't know
if I can do this.

1684
01:21:06,870 --> 01:21:09,536
Gabby, it's just
like you said.

1685
01:21:09,635 --> 01:21:12,869
This is the most noble
thing a toy can do.

1686
01:21:17,801 --> 01:21:18,803
Okay.

1687
01:21:18,865 --> 01:21:21,903
Just edge yourself
a bit into the light.

1688
01:21:24,701 --> 01:21:26,670
Not too far.

1689
01:21:26,769 --> 01:21:28,036
That's it.

1690
01:21:29,201 --> 01:21:31,769
Perfect.

1691
01:21:31,870 --> 01:21:33,902
- Winner, winner...
- Chicken dinner.

1692
01:21:56,003 --> 01:21:58,102
Are you lost, too?

1693
01:22:02,065 --> 01:22:05,015
<i>I'm Gabby Gabby.
Will you be my friend?</i>

1694
01:22:05,918 --> 01:22:07,452
I'll help you.

1695
01:22:14,285 --> 01:22:18,019
Excuse me, can you...
Can you help us?

1696
01:22:18,120 --> 01:22:19,753
Oh, honey,
what's wrong?

1697
01:22:19,853 --> 01:22:21,286
I can't find
my mom and dad.

1698
01:22:21,385 --> 01:22:23,386
It's okay.
I'll help you find them.

1699
01:22:23,485 --> 01:22:24,885
I'm sure they're not far.

1700
01:22:24,985 --> 01:22:26,152
She was right next to us.

1701
01:22:26,252 --> 01:22:27,753
She was right here!

1702
01:22:27,852 --> 01:22:29,286
And I looked
away for one second.

1703
01:22:29,385 --> 01:22:30,485
Mommy!

1704
01:22:38,057 --> 01:22:39,458
I couldn't find you...

1705
01:22:39,557 --> 01:22:41,071
and then I found this doll.

1706
01:22:41,107 --> 01:22:42,107
You did?

1707
01:22:42,285 --> 01:22:43,786
Her name is Gabby Gabby.

1708
01:22:56,018 --> 01:22:58,853
Whoa.
We actually did that.

1709
01:22:58,952 --> 01:23:01,352
Oh, yeah. Yes!

1710
01:23:01,453 --> 01:23:03,286
That was amazing.

1711
01:23:03,385 --> 01:23:05,719
We make a great team, guys.

1712
01:23:07,052 --> 01:23:09,719
<i>Pull over now!</i>

1713
01:23:11,418 --> 01:23:13,120
Almost there.

1714
01:23:14,384 --> 01:23:16,087
- Stop!
- Stop!

1715
01:23:20,953 --> 01:23:22,786
Are we home?

1716
01:23:22,885 --> 01:23:24,252
Huh?

1717
01:23:25,985 --> 01:23:28,686
Sir, will you please
step out of the vehicle?

1718
01:23:28,785 --> 01:23:31,053
Dad's totally going to jail.

1719
01:23:37,468 --> 01:23:39,136
Everyone, topside.
Let's move.

1720
01:23:39,235 --> 01:23:42,235
Forky, I've got a very
important job for you.

1721
01:23:42,335 --> 01:23:44,037
For me?

1722
01:23:44,136 --> 01:23:46,137
Have a good night.

1723
01:23:47,202 --> 01:23:50,669
What the...?

1724
01:23:50,770 --> 01:23:52,703
You've gotta be
kidding me.

1725
01:24:07,234 --> 01:24:08,236
Hey.

1726
01:24:09,468 --> 01:24:12,135
Um... So long, cowboy.

1727
01:24:12,236 --> 01:24:13,969
Happy trails.

1728
01:24:17,835 --> 01:24:22,835
Billy, Goat, Gruff.
Take care of her, girls.

1729
01:24:29,135 --> 01:24:31,836
I'm glad
I got to see you again.

1730
01:24:33,367 --> 01:24:34,969
I... I don't...

1731
01:25:01,501 --> 01:25:03,036
Goodbye, Bo.

1732
01:25:27,835 --> 01:25:29,935
Buzz, I... I...

1733
01:25:31,801 --> 01:25:33,302
She'll be okay.

1734
01:25:36,501 --> 01:25:39,168
Bonnie will be okay.

1735
01:25:45,434 --> 01:25:46,769
You sure?

1736
01:25:46,870 --> 01:25:49,561
Hey. Listen to
your inner voice.

1737
01:26:19,160 --> 01:26:20,895
Bo?

1738
01:26:20,995 --> 01:26:22,094
Is it really her?

1739
01:26:22,194 --> 01:26:23,828
I'll be danged,
it's Bo!

1740
01:26:23,928 --> 01:26:25,294
Jessie.

1741
01:26:25,860 --> 01:26:27,093
Bo!

1742
01:27:00,093 --> 01:27:02,160
Oh!

1743
01:27:28,494 --> 01:27:30,094
So long, Forky.

1744
01:27:32,026 --> 01:27:34,728
Forky?
Who's watching the doors?

1745
01:27:36,261 --> 01:27:39,060
- Go, go, go!
- Oh, boy.

1746
01:27:39,161 --> 01:27:41,929
Oh, my goodness. The awning.
What is going on?

1747
01:28:15,584 --> 01:28:19,351
Does this mean
Woody's a lost toy?

1748
01:28:19,452 --> 01:28:20,819
He's not lost.

1749
01:28:21,719 --> 01:28:23,652
Not anymore.

1750
01:28:25,184 --> 01:28:27,119
To infinity...

1751
01:28:27,584 --> 01:28:30,052
And beyond.

1752
01:29:26,648 --> 01:29:28,416
Yay!

1753
01:29:28,546 --> 01:29:30,847
There goes
another one.

1754
01:29:30,933 --> 01:29:32,585
We're never
getting outta here.

1755
01:29:32,685 --> 01:29:33,813
Psst. Frog legs.

1756
01:29:33,883 --> 01:29:35,151
Up here,
Rainbow Connection.

1757
01:29:35,222 --> 01:29:37,800
You Mr. Toads wanna take
a wild ride with a kid?

1758
01:29:37,902 --> 01:29:38,986
We can make
that happen.

1759
01:29:39,084 --> 01:29:40,318
- You can?
- Really?

1760
01:29:40,418 --> 01:29:42,184
Oh, yeah!
Leave it to us, Jeremiah.

1761
01:29:45,185 --> 01:29:46,686
Aw.

1762
01:30:25,376 --> 01:30:27,045
All right.
Nice job, gang!

1763
01:30:27,143 --> 01:30:28,377
Every prize
with a kid.

1764
01:30:28,476 --> 01:30:30,044
- What's next?
- Leave that to us.

1765
01:30:30,144 --> 01:30:31,811
- We know exactly what to do.
- Mmm-hmm.

1766
01:31:09,710 --> 01:31:11,410
Plush Rush!

1767
01:31:11,510 --> 01:31:13,244
How you like that, huh?

1768
01:31:13,344 --> 01:31:15,210
You got plush-rushed, son!

1769
01:31:15,310 --> 01:31:16,377
Dance!

1770
01:31:17,643 --> 01:31:19,351
Dance! Get those knees up!

1771
01:31:21,644 --> 01:31:24,145
Let's see those
feet move! Whoo!

1772
01:31:35,410 --> 01:31:37,776
Or we can get
more toys to kids.

1773
01:31:37,877 --> 01:31:39,644
Yeah, let's do that.

1774
01:31:41,644 --> 01:31:43,945
Do you really have
laser eyes?

1775
01:31:45,843 --> 01:31:46,844
Yeah.

1776
01:31:48,276 --> 01:31:49,510
Whoa.

1777
01:32:16,242 --> 01:32:17,878
Hi, toys. Bye, toys.

1778
01:32:18,909 --> 01:32:20,376
Jessie's back!

1779
01:32:20,477 --> 01:32:22,209
What's first grade like?
Tell me everything!

1780
01:32:22,310 --> 01:32:23,377
Well, it was...

1781
01:32:23,476 --> 01:32:24,643
How was
"Present and Explain"?

1782
01:32:24,743 --> 01:32:26,150
Uh, you mean "Show and Tell"
there, big guy.

1783
01:32:26,212 --> 01:32:27,656
You see
any kids eat paste?

1784
01:32:27,750 --> 01:32:28,611
Guys, listen!

1785
01:32:28,711 --> 01:32:31,339
Bonnie had a great day
in first grade.

1786
01:32:31,433 --> 01:32:33,376
She even made
a new friend in class.

1787
01:32:33,477 --> 01:32:35,748
Oh, she's already
making friends.

1788
01:32:35,827 --> 01:32:38,777
No, no,
she made a new friend.

1789
01:32:38,876 --> 01:32:41,510
Come on out, it's okay.

1790
01:32:59,609 --> 01:33:03,344
Hi. I'm, uh...
I'm Forky.

1791
01:33:03,444 --> 01:33:05,377
Trash?

1792
01:33:05,477 --> 01:33:08,777
No, no. Toy.
I am a...

1793
01:33:08,876 --> 01:33:11,144
We are all toys.

1794
01:33:11,244 --> 01:33:15,244
Unique,
beautiful toys.

1795
01:33:15,343 --> 01:33:18,643
I will explain everything.

1796
01:33:19,343 --> 01:33:23,510
How am I alive?

1797
01:33:25,743 --> 01:33:27,878
I don't know.
