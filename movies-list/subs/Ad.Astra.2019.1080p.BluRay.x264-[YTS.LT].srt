00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:54,423
No data was ever recovered.

161
00:11:54,425 --> 00:11:56,760
Deep space missions
were halted after that.

162
00:11:58,061 --> 00:11:59,695
Yes, that's him.

163
00:11:59,697 --> 00:12:03,266
Can you tell us how you
handled your father's absence?

164
00:12:04,935 --> 00:12:06,537
Well...

165
00:12:09,406 --> 00:12:11,840
My mother was
certainly distressed by it.

166
00:12:11,842 --> 00:12:14,275
Uh, she was quite ill
at the time.

167
00:12:14,277 --> 00:12:17,446
But he was,
uh, committed to his job...

168
00:12:17,448 --> 00:12:19,750
and I'm sure it was very
difficult for him as well.

169
00:12:21,017 --> 00:12:22,684
STROUD: Roy...

170
00:12:22,686 --> 00:12:27,090
we have something that might
come as quite a shock to you.

171
00:12:29,527 --> 00:12:33,929
We believe your father
is still alive near Neptune.

172
00:12:33,931 --> 00:12:35,497
Where exactly,
we do not know.

173
00:12:35,499 --> 00:12:37,198
Now, we've sent out
numerous drones,

174
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,670
but obviously,
it's a vast area to cover.

175
00:12:45,876 --> 00:12:49,011
My father's alive, sir?

176
00:12:49,013 --> 00:12:51,279
We believe so.

177
00:12:51,281 --> 00:12:53,782
STROUD: Roy, The Surge
seems to be the result

178
00:12:53,784 --> 00:12:56,585
of some kind
of anti-matter reaction.

179
00:12:56,587 --> 00:12:59,388
Now, the Lima Project was
powered by that material...

180
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:01,492
and your father
was in charge of it.

181
00:13:02,058 --> 00:13:03,224
Now, we're talking about

182
00:13:03,226 --> 00:13:07,029
a potentially unstoppable
chain reaction here.

183
00:13:07,031 --> 00:13:09,230
The uncontrolled release
of anti-matter...

184
00:13:09,232 --> 00:13:10,599
could ultimately threaten

185
00:13:10,601 --> 00:13:14,135
the stability of
our entire solar system.

186
00:13:14,137 --> 00:13:16,807
All life could be destroyed.

187
00:13:18,174 --> 00:13:21,108
Major, we would
like you to send

188
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:24,078
a personal message on Mars
by secure laser...

189
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:27,816
to what we hope
is the Lima Project.

190
00:13:27,818 --> 00:13:28,951
The text of your message

191
00:13:28,953 --> 00:13:31,218
would be prepared in advance,
of course.

192
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:34,322
Mars, sir?
I'm going to Mars?

193
00:13:34,324 --> 00:13:37,861
It is the last secure hub
we have.

194
00:13:39,228 --> 00:13:41,863
STROUD: Roy,
we need to find out

195
00:13:41,865 --> 00:13:44,098
just what
we're up against here.

196
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,534
Our underground Mars base

197
00:13:45,536 --> 00:13:49,404
was the only one
unaffected by The Surge.

198
00:13:49,406 --> 00:13:51,238
And we believe
a personal plea,

199
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,710
from you to your father,
might elicit a response.

200
00:13:54,712 --> 00:13:56,445
We can track that signal...

201
00:13:56,447 --> 00:14:00,048
locate him and figure out
a way to stop this.

202
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:05,787
What is happening out there is
a crisis of unknown magnitude.

203
00:14:05,789 --> 00:14:09,190
Now, we're counting on you
to help us find him.

204
00:14:09,192 --> 00:14:11,260
Are you with us?

205
00:14:14,398 --> 00:14:16,999
- Yes, I am, sir.
- STROUD: Good.

206
00:14:17,001 --> 00:14:18,734
You deploy first
to the moon.

207
00:14:18,736 --> 00:14:20,035
Our long-range rockets

208
00:14:20,037 --> 00:14:21,403
are stationed there
on the Far Side.

209
00:14:21,405 --> 00:14:23,405
Everything after that will be
on a need-to-know basis.

210
00:14:23,407 --> 00:14:24,338
Yes, sir.

211
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,475
Given the magnitude
of the threat...

212
00:14:26,477 --> 00:14:30,412
a cover story is being
formulated to avoid all panic.

213
00:14:30,414 --> 00:14:32,781
You'll be traveling
commercially to the moon

214
00:14:32,783 --> 00:14:33,949
to keep a low profile.

215
00:14:33,951 --> 00:14:36,551
Colonel Pruitt will be your
point person from here on.

216
00:14:36,553 --> 00:14:39,823
Absolute top secrecy
must be maintained.

I'm here to go

246
00:16:20,824 --> 00:16:22,557
Keep my eye on ya.

247
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:25,462
Colonel Pruitt,
good to meet you.

248
00:16:26,597 --> 00:16:27,631
Actually...

249
00:16:29,332 --> 00:16:31,233
we've met.

250
00:16:31,235 --> 00:16:34,538
It was a long time ago.
I knew your dad.

251
00:16:35,405 --> 00:16:37,405
We were close,
he and I.

252
00:16:37,407 --> 00:16:41,378
We started out together,
went to Purdue together.

253
00:16:42,212 --> 00:16:44,112
He was a brilliant man.

254
00:16:44,114 --> 00:16:46,214
- I know.
- Yeah.

255
00:16:46,216 --> 00:16:48,583
And I remember going
to the house and seeing you.

256
00:16:48,585 --> 00:16:50,752
You were running around
everywhere.

257
00:16:50,754 --> 00:16:53,855
You drove your
poor mother nuts, but...

258
00:16:53,857 --> 00:16:55,392
How do you feel?

259
00:16:59,229 --> 00:17:01,295
Is this part
of my psych eval?

260
00:17:01,297 --> 00:17:03,965
(CHUCKLES) Uh...

261
00:17:03,967 --> 00:17:05,700
No, not really, but yes.

262
00:17:05,702 --> 00:17:08,804
I mean, you're going
to be monitored constantly...

263
00:17:08,806 --> 00:17:12,741
your mental state,
your emotional state.

264
00:17:12,743 --> 00:17:16,778
You have a direct connection
with the subject.

265
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:20,517
Colonel, for what it's worth,
I think my father's dead.

267
00:17:25,255 --> 00:17:27,055
Yeah, um...

268
00:17:27,057 --> 00:17:33,295
I was a lunar astronaut
for SPACECOM for 31 years.

269
00:17:33,297 --> 00:17:36,798
And I came to the
realization out there...

270
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:40,435
a voyage of exploration
can be used

271
00:17:40,437 --> 00:17:43,972
for something
as simple as escape.

272
00:17:43,974 --> 00:17:45,941
I'm telling you this, Roy,

273
00:17:45,943 --> 00:17:50,312
because we have to
hold out the possibility...

274
00:17:50,314 --> 00:17:53,984
that your father
may be hiding from us.

275
00:17:58,522 --> 00:18:00,657
Do you think
you're ready to go?

276
00:18:03,227 --> 00:18:04,893
I'm ready.

277
00:18:04,895 --> 00:18:05,963

01:29:24,941 --> 01:29:28,678
I have cataracts,
I don't see very well.

1245
01:29:40,257 --> 01:29:41,791
Hi, Dad.

1246
01:29:43,994 --> 01:29:45,328

1247
01:29:46,263 --> 01:29:48,564

1251
01:29:57,174 --> 01:30:00,411
I'm trying to stop
this goddamn surge.

1252
01:30:03,246 --> 01:30:04,814
What happened?

1253
01:30:06,183 --> 01:30:11,019
My last loyal few
tried to escape.

1254
01:30:11,021 --> 01:30:13,391
And they started all this.

1255
01:30:15,859 --> 01:30:18,927
They caused a meltdown
out there, Roy.

1256
01:30:18,929 --> 01:30:23,233
We fought, and our struggle
caused catastrophe.

This is home.

1263
01:30:39,883 --> 01:30:43,253
This is a one-way voyage,
my son.

1264
01:30:44,054 --> 01:30:46,790
You're talking about Earth?

1265
01:30:48,191 --> 01:30:49,891
There was never anything
for me there.

1266
01:30:49,893 --> 01:30:52,327
I never cared about you,
or your mother...

1267
01:30:52,329 --> 01:30:55,899
or any of your small ideas.

1268

For 30 years...

1269

I've been breathing this air,
eating this food...

1270
01:31:01,037 --> 01:31:04,074
enduring these hardships...

1271
01:31:05,809 --> 01:31:08,512
and I never once thought
about home.

1272
01:31:12,349 --> 01:31:13,883
I know, Dad.

1273
01:31:28,331 --> 01:31:31,500
I knew this would
widow your mother...

1274
01:31:31,502 --> 01:31:33,803
and orphan you...

1275
01:31:36,607 --> 01:31:39,175
but I found my destiny.

1276
01:31:46,584 --> 01:31:48,486
So, I abandoned my son.

1277
01:31:53,357 --> 01:31:55,393
I still love you, Dad.

1278
01:32:04,834 --> 01:32:07,337
I'm taking you back.

1279
01:32:08,472 --> 01:32:11,074
Hmm... I have work to do.

1280
01:32:13,711 --> 01:32:16,946

1281
01:32:17,947 --> 01:32:20,551
I must find intelligent life.

1282
01:32:23,219 --> 01:32:25,088
It's time to go.

1283
01:32:26,956 --> 01:32:29,393
We don't have much time.

1284
01:32:39,269 --> 01:32:40,604
Come on.

1285
01:33:21,545 --> 01:33:24,912
I admire your courage
for coming alone, Roy...

1286

1287
01:33:26,983 --> 01:33:29,285
following me here.

1288
01:33:31,589 --> 01:33:34,492
Makes me wonder what we could
have accomplished together.

1289
01:33:37,428 --> 01:33:38,694
But I guess...

1290
01:33:38,696 --> 01:33:41,730
the fates have deprived me

of the partner
I should have had.

1292

If we'd had more people
like you...

1293

we could have pressed on,

1294
01:33:52,142 --> 01:33:54,043
could've found
what we're looking for.

1295
01:33:57,147 --> 01:34:00,248
My crew examined
all the data...

1296
01:34:00,250 --> 01:34:03,752
discovered no other life
out there.

1297
01:34:03,754 --> 01:34:05,623
No other consciousness.

1298
