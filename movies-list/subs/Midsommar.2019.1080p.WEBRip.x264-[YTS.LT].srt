1
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,627
<i>Hello, you have reached...</i>

2
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:51,768
<i>The Ardor residence.</i>

3
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:54,354
<i>Please leave a message after the tone.</i>

4
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,783
<i>Hey, Mom, hey, Dad, it's Dani.</i>

5
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:04,831
<i>Uh, I'm sorry to be calling so late.
I'm just checking in.</i>

6
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:06,748
<i>Making sure everything's okay.</i>

7
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:10,704
<i>Um... Listen, I got
kind of a scary email from Terri</i>

8
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:15,462
<i>and she hasn't been responding.
Surprise, surprise.</i>

9
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:17,509
<i>But, uh, yeah,</i>

10
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:21,556
<i>it sounds like you guys have been fighting
or something happened.</i>

11
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:24,385
<i>Anyway, uh, I just got a little worried.</i>

12
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:26,390
<i>So, um, if you can call when you can,</i>

13
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,692
<i>and of course, you know I'm... I'm always
here if you need anything, of course.</i>

14
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:37,939
Okay, um, I love you.
All right, bye.

15
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:50,811
- <i>Hey.
- Hey, sweetie.</i>

16
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,388
What are you up to?

17
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:56,101
<i>Um, just smoked some resin with Mark</i>

18
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:58,982
<i>- and now we're getting pizza.</i>
- Oh, nice.

19
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,359
- <i>Hi, Dani. Hi, Dani.</i>
- Yeah, um...

20
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:05,281
<i>He's saying "hi"
right now, over and over.</i>

21
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,282
- Hi, Mark.
<i>- Hi, Mark.</i>

22
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:14,870
So, I was calling just to see if you...
you still wanted to hang out later?

23
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:17,088
<i>Oh.</i>

24
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:21,589
<i>Did we talk about
doing something tonight?</i>

25
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:25,888
I mean, not... not concretely,
but, um, I just wanted to see...

26
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:29,809
<i>Um... Well... Okay.</i>

27
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:32,433
<i>Yeah, I should be able
to swing by.</i>

28
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:33,763
- Cool.
<i>- Yeah, okay.</i>

29
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:40,816
<i>How's the sister situation?</i>

30
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:44,823
Um, well...

31
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:48,327
Uh, yeah, um...

32
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:54,993
I emailed her three times
and still no response,

33
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:58,124
so I'm getting a little bit nervous, so...

34
00:04:58,215 --> 00:05:00,423
<i>I'm sure it's fine.</i>

35
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:02,462
Yeah, probably...

36
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:06,387
<i>She does this every other day, Dani,
and only because you let her.</i>

37
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:08,117
Well, I don't let her,
she's bipolar, so...

38
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,929
<i>Yeah, I know.
But, you do though, babe.</i>

39
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:13,102
<i>You go straight to crisis mode.</i>

40
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:19,313
Well, she's my sister and even you said
that this email seemed different.

41
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:21,234
<i>Yeah, right, but...</i>

42
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:24,572
<i>Is it though, really?</i>

43
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:26,945
<i>It's still just another
obvious ploy for attention</i>

44
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:29,322
<i>just like every other
panic attack she's given you.</i>

45
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:31,996
Yeah, you're right.

46
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,241
You are right, yeah, I know.

47
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,918
<i>I mean, the more you respond
the more she's encouraged to keep...</i>

48
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,107
No, I know, I know, I know.
You're right, you're right.

49
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:42,214
I just... I just needed
to be reminded, thank you.

50
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,385
I'm very lucky to have you.

51
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:48,550
<i>Yeah, well.</i>

52
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:50,765
I love you.

53
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:54,726
<i>I love you.</i>

54
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:00,065
Okay, uh, I'll see you later?

55
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:02,484
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- Okay.

56
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:04,528
- Bye, Mark.
<i>- Bye, Mark.</i>

57
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:07,322
Okay, I love you.

58
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:08,820
<i>- All right.
- Bye.</i>

59
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,350
It's in his tone, like,
you can hear it in his voice,

60
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,254
he's just working up the nerve
to say something.

61
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:17,825
<i>So be direct!
Confront him.</i>

62
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,146
What if
I've scared him, though?

63
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,773
I'm always roping him
into my family crap.

64
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:22,038
<i>How do you rope him in?</i>

65
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:23,418
I'm always leaning on him!

66
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:24,999
Like, I even called him today
in tears

67
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:27,551
because my sister wrote
another stupid scary email.

68
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:29,970
<i>That's what he's there for.</i>

69
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:34,175
- What if I'm scaring him off?
<i>- What did your sister write?</i>

70
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:35,430
Mmm.

71
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,560
Just some ominous bullshit

72
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:38,813
like she always does
and it's torture.

73
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,811
And I lean on him constantly
for support.

74
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:43,393
Like, what if
I have overwhelmed him

75
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:45,603
and he thinks that I just have
too much baggage?

76
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:48,189
<i>Well, if that's the case,
then good riddance, right?</i>

77
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:51,993
No, not if I... I went too far,
if I leaned too much.

78
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:54,411
<i>You didn't! He should be there
when you need him.</i>

79
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,079
Yeah, but what if
I need him too often

80
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,532
and it becomes a chore?

81
00:06:57,626 --> 00:06:59,788
<i>Then he's not the right guy.</i>

82
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:01,414
<i>Because it shouldn't
ever be a chore.</i>

83
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,086
<i>Would it be a chore
if he leaned on you?</i>

84
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:04,692
Yeah, but he doesn't ask me
for anything.

85
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:05,876
I've never even seen him cry,

86
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:08,043
so I'm the only one
that's leaning.

87
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:10,072
<i>Or the only one opening up.</i>

88
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,088
<i>The only one
making yourself vulnerable.</i>

89
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:13,764
<i>That's intimacy.</i>

90
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,682
Dude.

91
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,852
You have gotta
get off the fence with this.

92
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:23,437
What if I regret it later
and I can't get her back?

93
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:25,313
- You don't want her back!
- But I might.

94
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:30,611
Okay, well, then you can bitch to us
about how much you regret it for that day

95
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,191
and then we'll remind you again

96
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,055
that you've been wanting out
of this stupid relationship

97
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:35,536
for, like, a year now

98
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:37,909
and then you can find a chick
who actually likes sex

99
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:40,019
and doesn't drag you through
a million hoops every day.

100
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:42,501
Do you think there is
a masochistic part of you

101
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:44,328
that is playing out this particular drama

102
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:46,539
to avoid the work
you actually need to be doing?

103
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:51,252
What work do I need
to be doing, Josh, exactly?

104
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:54,555
Well, I dunno, your prospectus, maybe?
Your Ph.D...

105
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:56,758
Wow, okay, thanks for the psychoanalysis.

106
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:59,538
It's not about academics, Josh.
I'm just trying to get you focused.

107
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:01,349
- Change?
- Um, that's for you.

108
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:07,602
See? You could be getting
that girl pregnant right now.

109
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:10,536
And don't forget about all the Swedish
women you can impregnate in June.

110
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:11,905
- Okay, guys.
- Don't forget

111
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:13,135
- about all the Swedish milkmaids.
- Mm-hmm.

112
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:16,990
That's not her again.

113
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:19,537
Seriously?

114
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:22,416
Oh, my God.

115
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,355
- She needs a therapist, dude.
- She has a therapist.

116
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:27,963
Oh, so then she should call her therapist
and not you. It's literally abuse.

117
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:29,415
- She's abusing you.
- 'Scuse me.

118
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,501
- Nope.
- Oh, my God.

119
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,085
Okay, excuse me, guys.

120
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,511
- Well...
- Great.

121
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:44,267
- Hey.
<i>- No.</i>

122
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:48,397
- Dani, babe?
<i>- Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no.</i>

123
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:31,560
No, no, no, no, no!

124
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,993
Hey, babe.
How you feeling?

125
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:24,752
I'm up.

126
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,056
Where are you going?

127
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:34,057
I was just gonna go to that party for 45
minutes. But you just keep sleeping.

128
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:37,060
No. No, I'll come with you.

129
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:40,234
- You sure you got enough sleep?
- I wasn't sleeping anyway.

130
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,738
Yeah, I'm fucking
dreading the summer.

131
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:49,739
Stuck in a shit-ass hole listening
to my stepmom fuck my dad all day.

132
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:52,071
I'll listen to your stepmom
fuck your dad.

133
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:54,407
Hey, Josh, you, uh,
going to Europe?

134
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:58,460
Uh, yeah, yeah, for my thesis,
you know, we all are.

135
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:00,663
Oh, you're all going?

136
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:03,841
Yeah, they're all coming to
visit my home in Halsingland.

137
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:05,087
Sweden.

138
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:08,888
Oh, any occasion,
or is it just for fun?

139
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:13,843
Uh, well, I'm... I'm doing my research
on European midsummer traditions,

140
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:15,723
these guys
are just tagging along.

141
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:18,351
Mr. Pelle's invited us to an
authentic hippie midsummer

142
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:20,182
at his yodeling farm.

143
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:24,187
Oh, yeah?

144
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:28,987
I mean, we were talking about it. We were
thinking about it.

145
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:33,362
For when?

146
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:36,540
- Uh...
- Mid-June to mid-July.

147
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:40,165
- Yeah, two weeks from now?
- Yeah.

148
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:42,792
I mean, that's if we even go.

149
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:46,842
I'm probably not gonna go, but...
Yeah, we were talking about it.

150
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:31,595
- You okay?
- Mm-hmm. Fine.

151
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:39,929
That was just really weird.

152
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,183
What was?

153
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:50,981
The... Sweden.

154
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,493
I had no idea.

155
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,908
Well, what do you mean?
'Cause I told you I wanted to go.

156
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:06,630
Okay, fine, but I didn't know
you were going.

157
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:10,964
I just decided today.

158
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:16,299
- I wasn't keeping it from you.
- You already have a ticket.

159
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:21,512
I'm sorry?

160
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:32,194
Okay, well, just imagine if you were
at a party and someone said,

161
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:34,400
"Hey, what're you doing
for summer?"

162
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:36,531
And then my friend said,

163
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:40,285
"Oh, we're going to China for three months
and we're leaving in two weeks..."

164
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:41,727
It's Sweden, for a month and a half.

165
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:43,270
And it was the first
you'd ever heard of it.

166
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:46,458
Okay. I told you
I wanted to go to Sweden.

167
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:48,584
No, you said it would be cool to go.

168
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,736
Yeah, and then I got the opportunity
and I decided to do it.

169
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,174
Look, I don't mind you going. I just wish
you would've told me, that's all.

170
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:57,347
Well, I just apologized, Dani.

171
00:16:57,433 --> 00:17:01,052
You didn't apologize, you said sorry,
which sounds more like, "Too bad."

172
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:09,985
- Maybe I should just go home.
- What? No, no.

173
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:12,529
I'm just trying to understand.

174
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:14,968
- And I'm trying to apologize.
- And I don't need an apology.

175
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:17,575
I don't, I just wanted to talk
about it, that's all.

176
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:22,017
I really think I should just leave.

177
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,873
No, no, no, no.
Please, please, please.

178
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,395
I'm not... I'm not trying to attack you.

179
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:26,772
- It really feels like you are.
- I'm not.

180
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:28,378
Well, then... Well, then I'm sorry.

181
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:31,832
I'm... I just got confused. I'm sorry, I...

182
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:34,043
Hey, please, c'mon, can you come? Just...

183
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:36,423
- Can you come and sit with me, please?
- Stop.

184
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:38,881
Please, and we can talk about it?

185
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:41,763
Look, it just... It just felt
really weird, okay?

186
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:45,892
But I'm fine, I think it's great
that you're going to Sweden, I do.

187
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:49,976
I think it's amazing.
Are you going for your thesis?

188
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:54,070
I don't know what my thesis is.

189
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:57,194
I know and it... it can... It will...

190
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,112
It can be inspiring, right?

191
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:04,660
Right?

192
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:10,921
In Stockholm, are there
any, like, meatball sex clubs

193
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:13,215
we should hit up before we head north?

194
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:14,917
No, we're going straight north.

195
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,323
Not straight-straight, though, right?

196
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:20,304
We gotta go through Stockholm
to get there.

197
00:18:20,391 --> 00:18:23,759
No, it's the opposite direction.
Stockholm is south of our land.

198
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:26,596
Guys, it's Dani.
She's coming up.

199
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,681
Okay.

200
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:33,189
- Should we clear all this?
- No, it's fine.

201
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:45,073
Um, I invited Dani to come to Sweden.
So you guys know.

202
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,994
She's not actually gonna come, but I
invited her just to not make it weird.

203
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:56,584
- You invited her to...
- Mm-hmm. But she's not coming.

204
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,423
She doesn't want to?

205
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:06,977
I invited her and she accepted,
but she's not actually coming to Sweden.

206
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,471
Okay.

207
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:13,661
Guys, you know
what she's been going through.

208
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:18,439
Yeah, no, dude, I just, uh,
thought it was...

209
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:19,864
Yeah, dude, nobody minds.

210
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,803
Thought you were saying
something else, that's all.

211
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,409
Okay, that's great.

212
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:28,328
And just so we're clear,
you guys told me to invite her

213
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:29,770
and you all know that she's coming.

214
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:30,954
Agreed?

215
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,289
Yep.

216
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,837
- Hey!
- Hey, babe!

217
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,460
Hey, guys.

218
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,337
- Hey.
- Yo.

219
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:39,668
How's it going?

220
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:43,506
- We're chilling.
- Nice.

221
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:48,552
So, Sweden.

222
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:50,123
- Yeah.
- You're coming, right?

223
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:55,688
I mean, I... I guess so, if that's not
completely ruining you guys' plans.

224
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:57,815
- Oh, no, no.
- No, not at all.

225
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:07,155
Uh, Christian, can I get you to take
a look at this paragraph real quick?

226
00:20:07,248 --> 00:20:09,661
Uh, yeah, sure.

227
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,117
- I'll be back.
- Mm-hmm.

228
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:19,166
- Hey, Pelle.
- Hi.

229
00:20:28,102 --> 00:20:31,345
- What were you drawing?
- Uh, just the table.

230
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:32,646
Oh.

231
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:36,892
- How have you been? Yeah?
- Pretty good.

232
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:39,979
Survived finals, you know.

233
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,780
- And you?
- Uh...

234
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:47,077
I didn't quite finish,
but they're giving me a break this year.

235
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,242
Oh, God, yes, yes,
of course. Sorry.

236
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:54,042
Yeah, it's, uh... How did you like
the Anthropology department?

237
00:20:54,128 --> 00:20:57,542
I like it, yeah.
Not as much as this one maybe, but...

238
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:03,468
- You're doing Psychiatry, right?
- Uh, Psychology, yeah.

239
00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:06,092
- Okay.
- That's how you know I'm nuts.

240
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:08,219
Yeah, also that funny look in your eye.

241
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,889
So you're coming to Halsingland?

242
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:13,515
I guess so, yeah.

243
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:16,974
And, um, we'll actually
be arriving on my birthday.

244
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:19,730
- Well, happy birthday.
- Thank you!

245
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:24,360
Yeah, Christian says you've
got this special week planned.

246
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:28,034
Yeah, it's sort of a crazy
nine-day festival my family's doing.

247
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,112
- Lots of pageantry...
- Uh-huh.

248
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:31,766
...special ceremonies, and dressing up.

249
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:33,494
That sounds fun.

250
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:37,373
It'll probably seem very silly.
But, it's like theater.

251
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:41,753
Yeah, Christian says you're...
You're from like a commune, right?

252
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:45,051
Yeah, we're...
We're a small community.

253
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,470
Here. I'll show you.

254
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:54,014
Oh, wow.

255
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:56,767
I see what you mean about the pageantry.

256
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:58,210
Yeah, we make
those clothes special

257
00:21:58,234 --> 00:22:00,021
for every winter and summer solstice.

258
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:03,353
I mean, everybody sort of does
everything together.

259
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:04,813
That's an interesting symbol.

260
00:22:04,907 --> 00:22:08,366
Yeah, we're taught
the Runic alphabet, so...

261
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:10,159
Whoa, who's that one?

262
00:22:10,246 --> 00:22:14,832
- That's last year's May Queen.
- Uh-huh. Beautiful.

263
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:21,004
You know, I'm very,
very glad you're coming.

264
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:25,960
- I-I think it's very good you're coming.
- Thank you.

265
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:28,678
Also, I...

266
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:30,380
I never had the chance to tell you...

267
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:33,217
- Mmm.
- ...but I was...

268
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:37,395
I was so very sorry
to hear about your loss.

269
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:40,144
- Oh.
- What happened, I mean,

270
00:22:40,234 --> 00:22:43,568
I can't even imagine. I mean...

271
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:45,520
- I lost my parents, too, so...
- Okay.

272
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:47,105
I kind of have some idea.

273
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,861
- I'm sorry.
- No!

274
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:50,317
- No, I'm sorry.
- No, you're...

275
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:52,494
I'm gonna just go
to the bathroom, thank you.

276
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:44,399
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

277
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:48,133
<i>we are beginning our initial
descent into Stockholm...</i>

278
00:23:57,061 --> 00:24:00,054
Oh, my God, the women here.

279
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:01,854
What is it that makes them hotter?

280
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:04,775
The Vikings grabbed
all the best babes from other countries

281
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,443
and dragged them over.

282
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:09,771
Christian, you can do
your thesis on that.

283
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:12,482
- How long is the drive?
- About four hours.

284
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:14,533
Oh, my God.

285
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:23,845
Okay,
this is the first stop.

286
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:26,977
- This is it?
- Not quite, almost.

287
00:25:32,156 --> 00:25:34,068
Pelle!

288
00:25:34,158 --> 00:25:35,158
- Hey!
- Hey!

289
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:36,511
- Just beautiful.
- Oh, my God.

290
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:39,118
Hey, guys, so these are younger people
from my village.

291
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:41,662
They're also returning
from their trips outside.

292
00:25:41,749 --> 00:25:43,206
Come on over.

293
00:25:44,585 --> 00:25:48,044
Hey! These are my friends from America.

294
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:52,874
- Oh, dude.
- Hey.

295
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:54,004
Just fucking walk.

296
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:55,710
Yeah, dude, there's so many bugs.

297
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:57,420
- It's beautiful, huh?
- Mmm.

298
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:05,012
Okay, so this is, uh...

299
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:06,471
- Mark, Dani...
- Hi.

300
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:09,308
Christian and Josh.

301
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,063
What?

302
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:12,735
Give me just one second.

303
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:16,384
- You think he knows that guy?
- He sounded mad.

304
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:28,376
That must be good.

305
00:26:34,176 --> 00:26:36,543
Here! Come on over, come on over.

306
00:26:36,637 --> 00:26:39,220
This is, uh, these are
my great friends from America.

307
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:41,923
- Christian, Dani, Josh, and Mark.
- Hi.

308
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:45,510
Meet my brother, Ingemar. Uh, best friends
since we were babies, actually.

309
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:46,890
Yeah.

310
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:50,144
So, Christian, Josh, Mark...

311
00:26:50,234 --> 00:26:51,270
- Dani? Yeah!
- Yeah!

312
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,443
Awesome! And say hello to my friends.

313
00:26:53,529 --> 00:26:56,647
- This is Simon and Connie from London.
- How's it going?

314
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,823
- Hi.
- Simon, this is Pelle...

315
00:26:58,909 --> 00:27:02,448
And these are all the names
I just learned two seconds ago.

316
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:05,864
Perfect timing, by the way.

317
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:08,746
We... we just took these
five minutes ago.

318
00:27:08,836 --> 00:27:11,203
Haven't even started coming up yet.

319
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:13,288
Oh, shit!

320
00:27:13,382 --> 00:27:16,216
Do you guys wanna take it now
or should we settle in first?

321
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:17,612
Fuck it, let's just take it now, right?

322
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:19,343
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Great.

323
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:23,969
Uh, you know what, I might have to find
my footing first if that's okay.

324
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:26,722
- Uh, yeah, of course.
- Yeah? Okay.

325
00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:29,725
And listen, if you're feeling uneasy,
you don't have to take them at all.

326
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:32,558
No. No, no, no. I just...
I wanna feel settled first.

327
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:33,937
- Okay.
- Okay.

328
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:37,232
- I'll wait.
- No, no, you go ahead.

329
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:38,529
- No, I'll wait.
- Please.

330
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:40,231
I want us to come up together.

331
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:42,817
- Ready?
- Okay?

332
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:45,278
Guys, I'm gonna wait for Dani,
so you just go ahead.

333
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:51,452
Dude, we can't take them at different
times, they'll be totally separate trips.

334
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:55,042
You wanna wait for us then?

335
00:28:01,138 --> 00:28:02,532
You know what? It's fine, it's fine.

336
00:28:02,556 --> 00:28:04,236
- Babe... Babe, no.
- I'm ready.

337
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:05,368
- No, it's okay.
- Don't feel rushed.

338
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:08,806
I don't, I don't. It's fine, I'm ready.

339
00:28:08,896 --> 00:28:10,262
Are you sure?

340
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:14,269
Yes, Mark, thank you.

341
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,021
- They've made mushroom tea.
- Mm-hmm.

342
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:17,693
If you prefer against the taste.

343
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:20,021
Uh, yeah, okay, I'll try that, thank you.

344
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:21,606
- Ingemar? Ingemar?
- Ingemar.

345
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,113
- Ingemar, okay. Thank you.
- Perfect.

346
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,612
Don't let Mark be the one
to pressure you of all people.

347
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:28,787
He's not, he's not.

348
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:30,894
It will... It will get complicated
otherwise, it's fine.

349
00:28:30,918 --> 00:28:32,454
- Are you ready?
- Yes, thank you.

350
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,126
- There you go.
- Ooh.

351
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:35,249
Thanks, dude.

352
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:37,080
Okay, here we go then.

353
00:28:37,174 --> 00:28:38,693
- Think happy thoughts!
- Are you sure about this?

354
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:40,800
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm excited.
- Cheers!

355
00:28:42,471 --> 00:28:44,463
- All right.
- Yeah?

356
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:46,013
Are you sure about this?

357
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:48,136
I think it's gonna be fun.

358
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:49,593
- We're in?
- Yep, go.

359
00:28:55,317 --> 00:28:59,778
- What time is it?
- It's 9:00 p.m.

360
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:03,401
What do you mean?

361
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:07,735
What do you mean?

362
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:10,913
That can't be right! The sky is blue!

363
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:13,207
It's fine, it's Sweden.

364
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:16,286
That's not fine! Why is it like that?

365
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:19,214
It's okay, Mark.
It's the midnight sun.

366
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:21,632
That feels wrong, I don't like that!

367
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:24,927
- I promise you, it's okay.
- I'm not okay.

368
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:26,879
Oh, fuck, it's a new person.

369
00:29:26,974 --> 00:29:30,684
What? I don't want
new people right now.

370
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:34,353
No, new people are good, Mark.

371
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:35,680
Hi, hi!

372
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:41,732
- I'm just gonna lay down, okay?
- Yeah, do that.

373
00:29:41,822 --> 00:29:43,859
Everybody else lay down.

374
00:29:46,994 --> 00:29:49,407
Guys, do it, it feels so nice.

375
00:29:52,249 --> 00:29:54,491
Josh, can you lie down, please?

376
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,127
Can you feel that?

377
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:01,206
The energy. Coming up from the earth.

378
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:16,934
Look!

379
00:30:17,024 --> 00:30:19,516
The trees too, they're breathing.

380
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:30,319
Nature just knows instinctively
how to stay in harmony.

381
00:30:33,123 --> 00:30:36,207
Everything just mechanically
doing its part.

382
00:30:43,884 --> 00:30:46,092
You guys are like my family.

383
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:51,722
You're like my real, actual family.

384
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:55,138
Dani?

385
00:30:57,939 --> 00:31:02,559
Sorry. Uh, I'm gonna go for a walk.

386
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:04,268
I can walk, too.

387
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:06,980
No, I'm good.

388
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:12,072
No, no, no, no.

389
00:31:12,162 --> 00:31:15,451
Don't think that. You're fine.
It's almost your birthday.

390
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:18,999
You're okay, you're fine. You're fine.

391
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:31,091
Stop it! I'm fine.

392
00:31:31,181 --> 00:31:32,513
Hey, Dani!

393
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:37,973
How are you?

394
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:39,975
They were laughing at me.

395
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:43,729
What? No, no, no, I'm sure they weren't.

396
00:31:43,819 --> 00:31:46,106
They've been laughing.

397
00:31:46,196 --> 00:31:48,028
Want to come meet my friends?

398
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:54,945
Thank you. I'm sorry, thank you.

399
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:03,794
Stop it! Stop it, fuck!

400
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:11,260
You're okay, you're okay, you're okay.

401
00:32:47,174 --> 00:32:48,290
Hey.

402
00:32:55,849 --> 00:32:58,057
How long was I asleep?

403
00:32:59,561 --> 00:33:03,271
I mean, we found you here,
like, six hours ago.

404
00:33:09,613 --> 00:33:11,400
Did it get dark at all?

405
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:16,652
For a couple of hours, not completely.

406
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:23,625
- Is it tomorrow?
- I mean, from yesterday's perspective.

407
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:29,250
Come on.

408
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:35,636
- Where are we going?
- What we came for.

409
00:34:14,928 --> 00:34:17,011
Jesus, Pelle,
where are you taking us?

410
00:34:17,097 --> 00:34:19,714
Yeah, this is way
the hell out there.

411
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:25,769
Do they have ticks in Sweden?

412
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:28,142
Sweden has a tick problem.

413
00:34:28,233 --> 00:34:30,520
What?
No, they don't. Do they really?

414
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,226
Actually, it is a big problem.

415
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,984
Last summer, a record number of people
got tick-borne encephalitis.

416
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:38,236
What the fuck?
Are you serious?

417
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:40,443
Both my grandparents
died from ticks.

418
00:34:40,537 --> 00:34:42,324
Had to give them a closed casket funeral.

419
00:34:42,414 --> 00:34:46,078
Okay, Josh, I actually
have an uncle with Lyme.

420
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:49,956
And believe me, if you ask him, it was not
worth the pleasant picnic in the park.

421
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:51,207
He's fucked.

422
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:39,089
- So, this is the place.
- The tranquil and majestic Harga.

423
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:44,098
Pelle,
you know all these people?

424
00:35:44,184 --> 00:35:46,927
These are my family!

425
00:35:50,732 --> 00:35:53,292
So we're stopping in Waco
before going to Pelle's village?

426
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:08,948
Oh, thank you!

427
00:36:09,042 --> 00:36:11,250
- Oh, thank you.
- What is it? Strawberry?

428
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:13,147
- Oh, wow, thank you.
- Oh, thanks.

429
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:15,037
This bag?

430
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:16,588
Thank you... Uh, sorry.

431
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:21,423
Hey, guys?
Meet my sister, Dagny.

432
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:23,254
Born the exact same day as me.

433
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:26,932
- Hi.
- Dani, Josh, Mark, Christian.

434
00:36:29,062 --> 00:36:30,849
- Uh, <i>tack!</i>
- Thank you.

435
00:36:30,939 --> 00:36:32,931
- <i>Tack.</i>
- Hey.

436
00:36:44,244 --> 00:36:46,076
Father Odd!

437
00:37:03,972 --> 00:37:05,838
Sorry, these are my friends.

438
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:09,266
Christian, Dani, Josh, Mark.

439
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:10,468
- Hello.
- Hi.

440
00:37:12,439 --> 00:37:13,896
Welcome, welcome.

441
00:37:13,982 --> 00:37:16,520
- Hi, oh!
- Welcome home.

442
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:19,568
We are so very happy to have you.

443
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:21,020
Oh, thank you.

444
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:24,073
Pelle has an immaculate sense for people.

445
00:37:25,702 --> 00:37:27,284
I... I love what you're wearing.

446
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:28,431
- My frock?
- Uh-huh.

447
00:37:28,455 --> 00:37:30,868
Yeah, quite girly, no?

448
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:36,077
We do these as a tribute in respect
of Ymir and because of the nature's...

449
00:37:36,171 --> 00:37:41,166
hermaphrodite, I think,
qualities. Yeah.

450
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:46,095
Wow, I think the Sakhis saints
do the same thing in Brajbhoomi?

451
00:37:46,181 --> 00:37:48,889
So, we are your hosts.

452
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:52,343
So whatever you need, just say so
and we will accommodate, okay?

453
00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:53,928
- Thank you very much.
- Yeah.

454
00:37:54,022 --> 00:37:55,558
Today is all festivities.

455
00:37:55,648 --> 00:38:00,188
Um, just tomorrow, the official ceremony
begin and you are welcome!

456
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:02,440
- Welcome, welcome, welcome.
- Thank you.

457
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,362
Yeah. Enjoy.

458
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:06,691
Just... Thank you.

459
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:12,363
- That guy has a very red face.
- Yeah?

460
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:17,326
- Do we eat these?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

461
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:25,603
- Can I take photos?
- Um... Discreetly.

462
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:31,070
Thanks.

463
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,388
Oh, forgive me.

464
00:39:32,412 --> 00:39:36,406
I'm excluding the ones
who aren't of Swedish tongue.

465
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:41,164
Welcome to Harga, and happy midsummer!

466
00:39:41,254 --> 00:39:45,043
It has been 90 years
since our last great feast

467
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:48,467
and it will be 90 years before our next.

468
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:53,844
And what poetry that it's now the hottest
and brightest summer on record.

469
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:56,971
We already have so much to give back

470
00:39:57,061 --> 00:40:01,931
and so, without any further blathering,
let's raise our glasses.

471
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:08,271
Let our Nine-Day feast commence.

472
00:41:46,379 --> 00:41:48,621
You guys should join.

473
00:41:48,715 --> 00:41:52,083
Oh, no, I'm too scared.

474
00:41:58,224 --> 00:42:00,386
- All right.
- Oh, thanks, babe.

475
00:42:03,563 --> 00:42:05,395
What are the kids playing?

476
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:07,143
Skin the fool.

477
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:10,146
- Skin the fool?
- Yeah.

478
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:12,023
Precious.

479
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:27,493
Hey, Pelle,
can anybody just join in?

480
00:42:27,587 --> 00:42:30,955
You're an American,
just jam yourself in there.

481
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:32,631
All right.

482
00:42:35,136 --> 00:42:36,172
Hey.

483
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:39,212
Happy birthday.

484
00:42:42,018 --> 00:42:44,101
Oh, my gosh, Pelle.

485
00:42:44,187 --> 00:42:48,181
Just something I do for birthdays.
Maybe it's not appropriate?

486
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:52,063
No, no, no, no, not at all.
Thank you so much.

487
00:42:52,153 --> 00:42:54,190
It's beautiful.

488
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,522
Anyway, just between us.

489
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:59,567
Yeah, well...

490
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:02,653
Christian forgot anyway,
so this is amazing. Thank you.

491
00:43:02,747 --> 00:43:04,830
Oh.

492
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:10,583
No. No, no, no, I forgot to remind him
and it's not his fault, it's...

493
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:13,505
- Never mind, it's okay.
- This is beautiful.

494
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:15,924
Thank you so much, I'm really touched.

495
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:20,345
So, how do you support
this place?

496
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:24,015
Lumbering, linen, homeopathics.
Water power plant.

497
00:43:26,229 --> 00:43:27,765
School time over here.

498
00:43:28,815 --> 00:43:31,307
- Carving runes?
- Really?

499
00:43:33,069 --> 00:43:35,857
They put it under their pillow
and dream about its powers.

500
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:38,610
Oh, yeah.
I do that, too.

501
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:40,361
Oh, fuck.
There's a big one.

502
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:42,317
Oh, shit.

503
00:43:42,411 --> 00:43:44,494
What alphabet is that from?

504
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:47,493
Uh, the Younger Futhark.

505
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:49,324
I... I think?
Or is that medieval?

506
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:52,001
Actually, that is
the Elder Futhark.

507
00:43:52,088 --> 00:43:54,831
So, how long
have you two been together?

508
00:43:54,924 --> 00:43:57,132
- Oh, geez, um...
- Um...

509
00:43:57,218 --> 00:43:59,631
Just over
three and a half years.

510
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,086
Four years.

511
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:03,593
- No? Really?
- Yeah.

512
00:44:03,683 --> 00:44:06,847
Four years in two weeks.

513
00:44:06,936 --> 00:44:08,268
You're right, I'm sorry.

514
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:10,516
- You're right. Four years.
- Mm-hmm.

515
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:15,942
Yeah, um,
how did you guys all meet?

516
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:18,649
Well, uh...

517
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:20,776
We were all working on the same farm

518
00:44:20,867 --> 00:44:26,329
and funny enough, I was dating Connie
when Simon and me first became pals.

519
00:44:26,414 --> 00:44:28,701
Well, we'd been on a date.

520
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:30,874
And I didn't even actually
know it was a date, so...

521
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,201
You're right. No, no.

522
00:44:32,295 --> 00:44:33,981
I meant that Connie and me
had just become friends.

523
00:44:34,005 --> 00:44:35,871
We... We decided to be friends.

524
00:44:35,965 --> 00:44:39,629
And that was just before
Connie and Simon started dating.

525
00:44:39,719 --> 00:44:41,460
And now they're engaged.

526
00:44:41,554 --> 00:44:43,967
- What? Congratulations!
- Wow.

527
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:45,968
Which is amazing,
yes, congratulations.

528
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:48,926
Yeah, thanks. Yeah,
we actually asked Ingemar

529
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:50,352
to officiate the wedding.

530
00:44:50,438 --> 00:44:52,179
- Really?
- Nah.

531
00:44:52,273 --> 00:44:54,310
- Oh.
- What's that building over there?

532
00:44:55,318 --> 00:44:58,561
It's like a sacred temple, but no
one's allowed in there.

533
00:45:00,573 --> 00:45:02,906
Uh, let me show you
where we sleep.

534
00:45:02,992 --> 00:45:06,531
Let me show you
the <i>Rotvalta!</i>

535
00:45:06,621 --> 00:45:09,284
So we're just gonna ignore the bear then?

536
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:11,035
It's a bear.

537
00:45:15,922 --> 00:45:18,255
What's that?

538
00:45:18,341 --> 00:45:20,799
- We can check it out.
- Yeah.

539
00:45:29,477 --> 00:45:31,139
Love story.

540
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:12,263
Oh, wow. What? Wow.

541
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:17,309
Wow.

542
00:46:18,943 --> 00:46:21,185
Wow, wow, wow.

543
00:46:22,571 --> 00:46:25,780
Oh, man. Wow.

544
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:29,109
It's like in the Scripture.

545
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:34,531
What do you think?

546
00:46:36,252 --> 00:46:38,494
It's like another world.

547
00:46:38,587 --> 00:46:40,374
Amazing.

548
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:41,875
People just sleep here?

549
00:46:41,966 --> 00:46:44,299
Yeah, all the younger ones until
we turn 36

550
00:46:44,385 --> 00:46:45,967
and then we move
to the laborers house.

551
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:47,464
Why 36?

552
00:46:47,555 --> 00:46:49,842
Well, we think of life
like the seasons.

553
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:52,675
So you're a child until
you're 18 and that's Spring.

554
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:56,557
And then at some point, we all do our
Pilgrimage which is between 18 and 36.

555
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:58,263
That's Summer.

556
00:46:58,357 --> 00:47:03,648
And then from 36 to 54,
we're working age, which is Fall.

557
00:47:03,738 --> 00:47:08,324
And then finally from 54 to 72
you become a mentor.

558
00:47:09,327 --> 00:47:11,535
What happens at 72?

559
00:47:13,331 --> 00:47:16,415
Not a lot of privacy.

560
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,562
Yeah, what do you do
when you need to jerk off?

561
00:47:18,586 --> 00:47:21,189
Especially with all these dicks
on the wall. There's a lot of dicks.

562
00:47:37,897 --> 00:47:39,041
Did she say something?

563
00:47:39,065 --> 00:47:43,059
No, no, no, absolutely not. I just wanted
to let you know before, so...

564
00:47:43,152 --> 00:47:46,111
- Are these the May Queens?
- Yeah.

565
00:47:47,156 --> 00:47:50,570
Right. Uh, you'll actually
be here for that.

566
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:53,072
And who are your May Queens?

567
00:47:53,162 --> 00:47:55,870
Uh, every mid-summer,
we have this dance competition

568
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:57,618
and the winner gets crowned
and this is...

569
00:47:57,708 --> 00:48:00,371
- Oh, wow.
- Hey!

570
00:48:10,513 --> 00:48:13,802
Was that...
You saw that too, right?

571
00:48:16,352 --> 00:48:19,436
- Pelle, who was that?
- Inge.

572
00:48:19,522 --> 00:48:21,730
Oh, my God,
I want to give her a bath.

573
00:48:21,816 --> 00:48:25,150
Hey, can I pull you outside
for a sec?

574
00:48:25,236 --> 00:48:26,898
Yeah, sure.

575
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:31,106
Pelle,
tell her to come back.

576
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:45,291
<i>- ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>
- What?

577
00:48:45,381 --> 00:48:49,375
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

578
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:54,384
<i>♪ Happy birthday, dear Dani ♪</i>

579
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:58,888
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you. ♪
Fuck.</i>

580
00:49:00,813 --> 00:49:02,645
- Stop, it's fine.
- What?

581
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:05,728
You didn't think
I forgot, did you?

582
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:09,978
I'm sorry.

583
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:12,801
I'm sorry I got fucked up by the daylight
and I thought it was yesterday.

584
00:49:12,825 --> 00:49:14,094
- It's okay. It's fine.
- Happy birthday.

585
00:49:14,118 --> 00:49:15,554
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you. I'm not upset.

586
00:49:15,578 --> 00:49:16,614
It's okay.

587
00:49:16,704 --> 00:49:19,196
- You should be.
- I... I should be.

588
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:20,747
I'm sorry.

589
00:49:45,774 --> 00:49:50,144
All right, beauty rest.
Tomorrow's a big day.

590
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:53,696
What's tomorrow?

591
00:49:53,782 --> 00:49:55,523
First of the big ceremonies.

592
00:50:00,206 --> 00:50:01,947
<i>Attestupa.</i>

593
00:50:03,584 --> 00:50:04,791
What's that?

594
00:50:04,877 --> 00:50:08,746
Uh, it's too hard to explain, you'll get
a better sense tomorrow.

595
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:11,673
- Wait, seriously?
- You can't just tell me now?

596
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:17,178
Wait, you're not talking
about an actual one?

597
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:19,301
I mean, it's pretty actual.

598
00:50:19,391 --> 00:50:20,927
Fuck.

599
00:50:22,645 --> 00:50:24,261
Do you know what it is?

600
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:28,857
Dude!

601
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:32,276
Is it scary?

602
00:50:35,908 --> 00:50:37,900
That is so fucking annoying.

603
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:40,986
Yo! Check my scalp
for ticks, then I'll check yours.

604
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,663
Somebody should tell
those girls they're walking stupid.

605
00:52:18,052 --> 00:52:20,715
How long
do they typically stand?

606
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:23,797
We're going to stand
until it's right to sit.

607
00:52:26,894 --> 00:52:29,432
Hey. Oh.

608
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:32,184
- Are these for me?
- Mm-hmm.

609
00:52:32,274 --> 00:52:34,436
- You pick 'em backwards?
- Yeah.

610
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:40,707
- Are those the ones?
- Yeah.

611
00:54:07,578 --> 00:54:08,694
Dude, I'm so hungry.

612
00:54:08,787 --> 00:54:10,744
It's like they're trying
to make it gross.

613
00:54:25,387 --> 00:54:27,754
Her... Her mother
is on Pilgrimage.

614
00:54:27,848 --> 00:54:31,558
- Oh... Okay.
- Helps her to detach.

615
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:34,101
The babies
are raised here by everyone.

616
00:54:34,188 --> 00:54:36,430
Wow. You want this?

617
00:57:05,756 --> 00:57:07,497
Dude, are you
following them out?

618
00:57:07,591 --> 00:57:09,298
I'm beat.
I'm gonna go take a nap.

619
00:57:09,384 --> 00:57:11,876
- Okay, okay. Yeah.
- Yeah.

620
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:14,678
Wait,
what're we doing now?

621
00:59:13,508 --> 00:59:15,465
What is that book?

622
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:17,794
<i>Rubi Radr.
Our scripture.</i>

623
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:22,674
Can I read that?

624
00:59:22,768 --> 00:59:24,304
You would not be able.

625
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:51,405
Oh, my God!

626
01:01:54,961 --> 01:01:57,624
- It's fine.
- Did she jump?

627
01:01:57,714 --> 01:02:00,047
' - What the...
- ' It's part of the ceremony.

628
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:02,591
- What? No, she fell, she fell.
- Fuck!

629
01:02:02,677 --> 01:02:04,885
- She fell, right?
- Did she jump?

630
01:02:04,971 --> 01:02:08,305
- It's okay.
- Oh, my... Did she fall or did she jump?

631
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:10,678
It's okay, it's fine.
Don't worry.

632
01:02:10,769 --> 01:02:14,012
What do you mean it's fine?
She's fucking dead. Look at her head!

633
01:02:14,105 --> 01:02:17,143
- Look at her head, she's dead!
- It's a part of the ceremony.

634
01:02:17,234 --> 01:02:18,836
Why the fuck are you
standing there like that?

635
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:21,227
She just fucking jumped off the cliff.

636
01:02:21,321 --> 01:02:24,564
Are you freaking blind?
What the... Fuck!

637
01:02:28,328 --> 01:02:30,911
Oh, my God.

638
01:02:30,997 --> 01:02:32,909
What the fuck?

639
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:46,840
No, he's doing...
He's doing the same thing.

640
01:02:46,930 --> 01:02:50,219
He's doing the same
fucking thing!

641
01:02:50,308 --> 01:02:52,766
Someone stop!
Sir, don't do it.

642
01:02:52,852 --> 01:02:54,138
Tell him to stop.

643
01:02:54,229 --> 01:02:56,767
Why's everyone just
standing there, what the fuck?

644
01:02:56,856 --> 01:03:00,065
Sir, don't...
Don't jump, don't jump!

645
01:03:00,151 --> 01:03:01,892
Please, someone tell him
not to jump.

646
01:03:01,987 --> 01:03:03,256
- What the fuck?
- Someone tell him...

647
01:03:26,928 --> 01:03:29,045
- He's still alive.
- What's going on?

648
01:04:35,663 --> 01:04:37,199
Fuck, we're going.

649
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:40,124
- Fuck! This is fucked!
- Where?

650
01:04:40,210 --> 01:04:42,668
Fuck this! You're fucked!

651
01:04:42,754 --> 01:04:44,732
Fuck! You're all just fucking
standing there watching,

652
01:04:44,756 --> 01:04:46,122
what the fuck is wrong with you?

653
01:04:49,094 --> 01:04:50,974
- Please! Please!
- No, fucking leave her alone!

654
01:04:51,054 --> 01:04:52,761
Please, listen to me.
Let me explain!

655
01:04:52,847 --> 01:04:54,213
What? Explain what?

656
01:04:54,307 --> 01:04:56,299
- Please, my poor thing.
- Fucked!

657
01:04:56,393 --> 01:05:01,434
Please! What you just saw is a long, long,
long observed custom.

658
01:05:01,523 --> 01:05:03,185
- "Custom"? It's fucked!
- Yes.

659
01:05:03,274 --> 01:05:08,440
Those two who jumped have just reached
the end of their Harga life-cycle.

660
01:05:08,530 --> 01:05:12,149
And you need to understand it
as a great joy for them.

661
01:05:12,242 --> 01:05:14,825
- "Joy?"
- Yes, and when it is my turn,

662
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:17,278
it will be a great joy for me.

663
01:05:17,372 --> 01:05:21,161
- Fuck.
- We view life as a circle, a recycle.

664
01:05:21,251 --> 01:05:24,961
The lady who jumped,
her name was Ylva, yes?

665
01:05:25,046 --> 01:05:30,087
And that baby over there who is not
yet born will inherit that name.

666
01:05:30,176 --> 01:05:34,921
Instead of getting old and dying in pain
and fear and shame,

667
01:05:35,014 --> 01:05:39,224
we give our life. As a gesture.

668
01:05:39,310 --> 01:05:42,223
- A gesture?
- Before it can spoil.

669
01:05:42,313 --> 01:05:46,557
It does no good dying, lashing back
at the inevitable.

670
01:05:46,651 --> 01:05:49,314
It corrupts the spirit.

671
01:05:49,404 --> 01:05:52,363
I'm so sorry
I didn't warn you better.

672
01:05:57,412 --> 01:05:58,994
You feeling okay?

673
01:06:00,498 --> 01:06:02,581
I just really need to not be
here right now.

674
01:06:02,667 --> 01:06:03,908
Yeah.

675
01:06:09,174 --> 01:06:10,415
I'm gonna go.

676
01:06:10,508 --> 01:06:12,468
Just take some time
to yourself, okay?

677
01:06:51,174 --> 01:06:53,006
- Hey, dude...
- Hey!

678
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:55,546
Holy shit, right?

679
01:06:56,554 --> 01:07:00,218
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

680
01:07:00,308 --> 01:07:01,890
Good.

681
01:07:07,232 --> 01:07:09,849
Hey, listen. Um...

682
01:07:09,943 --> 01:07:14,904
I've been thinking about something that I
wanted to ask you, or tell you, actually.

683
01:07:16,324 --> 01:07:17,656
Um...

684
01:07:20,745 --> 01:07:23,909
I've been thinking
a lot about my thesis.

685
01:07:23,998 --> 01:07:30,666
And, um... I've decided I'm gonna
do it here. On Harga.

686
01:07:30,755 --> 01:07:35,591
And I wanted to tell you first, just so it
didn't seem like I wasn't telling you.

687
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:41,468
I feel like... I feel like
I can't tell if you're joking.

688
01:07:46,229 --> 01:07:49,563
I mean... I mean, you know I'm doing my
thesis on midsummer.

689
01:07:49,649 --> 01:07:51,732
- That's the reason why I'm here.
- Yeah.

690
01:07:53,653 --> 01:07:58,694
Yeah, but not on this community. I mean,
you're going to Germany and England next.

691
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:04,244
Well, you knew I was
gonna wanna do this.

692
01:08:05,290 --> 01:08:07,202
- No, I didn't.
- Oh, my God.

693
01:08:07,292 --> 01:08:09,124
I mean, did you even know
until just now?

694
01:08:09,210 --> 01:08:13,875
Christian, of course you did! Okay, do you
think I don't know what you're doing?

695
01:08:13,965 --> 01:08:16,423
It's actually
kind of outrageously unsubtle.

696
01:08:16,509 --> 01:08:19,126
The fact that you're being
this bold about it.

697
01:08:19,220 --> 01:08:22,429
I'm-I'm honestly kind of impressed.

698
01:08:22,515 --> 01:08:23,993
What the fuck, man?
What does that mean?

699
01:08:24,017 --> 01:08:26,298
Yeah, what the fuck! This is what I've
been working toward

700
01:08:26,352 --> 01:08:27,809
and you know it.

701
01:08:27,895 --> 01:08:29,999
That's why you look so guilty
right now, because you know.

702
01:08:30,023 --> 01:08:33,642
You know that what you're doing
is unethical and leechy and lazy.

703
01:08:33,735 --> 01:08:36,478
And, frankly, it's kind of sad.

704
01:08:36,571 --> 01:08:38,904
- Fuck you!
- No, dude, not fuck me!

705
01:08:38,990 --> 01:08:42,108
Find your own subject.
Or... Or your own passion.

706
01:08:42,201 --> 01:08:46,366
And, because... All right, look.
I am... I'm actually invested in this.

707
01:08:46,456 --> 01:08:49,995
This is not some glorified hobby
that I'm casually dipping my feet into.

708
01:08:57,842 --> 01:09:00,505
I'm gonna do my thesis here.

709
01:09:00,595 --> 01:09:04,635
If you're gonna do it here too,
I'm open to collaborating.

710
01:09:04,724 --> 01:09:07,967
And if not, I guess we can
both do separate theses on the Hargas.

711
01:09:15,693 --> 01:09:18,106
Dude, of all the things
to let me sleep through.

712
01:09:18,196 --> 01:09:19,653
What?

713
01:09:24,285 --> 01:09:26,722
- We're leaving tomorrow morning.
- I know we are.

714
01:09:26,746 --> 01:09:29,308
I told Christian this already,
and now I think he's trying to pretend

715
01:09:29,332 --> 01:09:31,915
like it's his idea,
so if he comes up to you...

716
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:33,562
Well, no, wait a minute.
I... I seriously doubt

717
01:09:33,586 --> 01:09:35,648
that the elders will approve
of anything being written down.

718
01:09:35,672 --> 01:09:37,004
They're extremely protective.

719
01:09:37,090 --> 01:09:38,651
Okay, so then, I'll just use
aliases for everything.

720
01:09:38,675 --> 01:09:40,319
- Problem solved.
- Then what would be the point?

721
01:09:40,343 --> 01:09:41,959
You couldn't even get it
peer reviewed.

722
01:09:42,053 --> 01:09:44,261
And Christian did already ask me this,
by the way,

723
01:09:44,347 --> 01:09:47,215
and I told him the same thing
I'm telling you now.

724
01:09:47,308 --> 01:09:49,470
I thought you said
you hadn't talked to him.

725
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:53,019
Ah, fuck. No. Okay, look, uh,
I'll ask the elders.

726
01:09:53,106 --> 01:09:54,893
- Okay? Good.
- Yep.

727
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:07,401
Dani?

728
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:11,197
Um... I'm really sorry, Pelle.

729
01:10:11,290 --> 01:10:13,268
Thank you for inviting me,
but I... I really have to go.

730
01:10:13,292 --> 01:10:14,874
Can someone maybe
drive me somewhere?

731
01:10:14,961 --> 01:10:16,873
I know I shouldn't have
let you stay for that.

732
01:10:16,963 --> 01:10:19,626
I mean, I know it looks
extreme. But we only...

733
01:10:19,716 --> 01:10:21,753
I don't know why I'm here, Pelle!

734
01:10:21,843 --> 01:10:24,363
I don't know why you invited us.
I don't know. I don't know why...

735
01:10:24,387 --> 01:10:25,864
- I don't know why I'm here.
- Okay, okay, okay.

736
01:10:25,888 --> 01:10:27,658
- It's fine. It's okay.
- I don't know and I can't...

737
01:10:27,682 --> 01:10:29,719
- Come on. Come on, sit down.
- No.

738
01:10:29,809 --> 01:10:30,869
Dani, please.

739
01:10:30,893 --> 01:10:33,476
Please sit down.

740
01:10:33,563 --> 01:10:34,724
Dani.

741
01:10:37,024 --> 01:10:39,812
I invited my friends because this is
a once-in-a-lifetime thing,

742
01:10:39,902 --> 01:10:41,359
and I wanted to share it.

743
01:10:41,446 --> 01:10:44,780
Especially with my friends who
I knew would appreciate it.

744
01:10:44,866 --> 01:10:47,700
- Because I... I am proud of this place.
- Okay.

745
01:10:47,785 --> 01:10:50,744
Okay, but I'm not an anthropologist
and I don't understand any of this.

746
01:10:50,830 --> 01:10:52,099
- Yes, yes, yes. I know.
- I don't get it.

747
01:10:52,123 --> 01:10:55,912
I know. And, and yet, I was
the most excited for you to come.

748
01:10:56,002 --> 01:10:59,746
Here. Here, smell this.

749
01:11:01,507 --> 01:11:02,623
What is it?

750
01:11:02,717 --> 01:11:04,754
- It calms you down.
- No, I'm fine.

751
01:11:04,844 --> 01:11:06,961
I don't want it.

752
01:11:08,181 --> 01:11:09,592
- Are you sure?
- No...

753
01:11:09,682 --> 01:11:11,827
I really want to go, Pelle.
I don't... I don't want it.

754
01:11:11,851 --> 01:11:14,389
Okay.

755
01:11:14,479 --> 01:11:16,391
I know what
you're going through, Dani.

756
01:11:18,149 --> 01:11:20,015
What am I going through?

757
01:11:20,109 --> 01:11:21,600
Because I lost
my parents, too.

758
01:11:21,694 --> 01:11:23,560
- What? No, no, Pelle.
- Yes, yes, yes...

759
01:11:23,654 --> 01:11:25,020
That is not what
I'm talking about.

760
01:11:25,114 --> 01:11:26,300
I'm not talking about my family.

761
01:11:26,324 --> 01:11:27,384
I know that's not
what you're talking about.

762
01:11:27,408 --> 01:11:28,510
I'm not talking about my family...

763
01:11:28,534 --> 01:11:30,929
I lost my parents when I was a little boy.
They burned up in a fire.

764
01:11:30,953 --> 01:11:33,115
No, I wasn't talking
about that.

765
01:11:33,206 --> 01:11:38,918
My parents, they burned up in a fire
and I became, technically, an orphan.

766
01:11:39,003 --> 01:11:41,791
So believe me when I tell you
that I know what it's like.

767
01:11:41,881 --> 01:11:44,498
Because I do, I really, really do.

768
01:11:47,053 --> 01:11:50,546
Yet my difference is, I never
got the chance to feel lost,

769
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:54,600
because I had a family here,

770
01:11:54,685 --> 01:11:58,804
where everyone embraced me
and swept me up.

771
01:12:00,399 --> 01:12:02,516
And I was raised by
a community that doesn't bicker

772
01:12:02,610 --> 01:12:06,820
over what's theirs and what's not theirs.

773
01:12:06,906 --> 01:12:09,239
That's what you were given.

774
01:12:09,325 --> 01:12:11,942
But I have always felt held.

775
01:12:16,207 --> 01:12:19,917
By a family. A real family.

776
01:12:24,549 --> 01:12:26,256
Which everyone deserves.

777
01:12:28,386 --> 01:12:30,048
And you deserve.

778
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:40,187
- Pelle, Christian could walk in.
- He's what I'm talking about.

779
01:12:43,317 --> 01:12:46,810
He's my good friend
and I like him, but...

780
01:12:46,904 --> 01:12:49,362
Dani, do you feel held by him?

781
01:12:52,159 --> 01:12:54,697
Does he feel like home to you?

782
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:38,533
Hey. How you doing?

783
01:13:38,623 --> 01:13:43,493
Today was tough.

784
01:13:43,586 --> 01:13:47,671
You gonna be okay?

785
01:13:47,757 --> 01:13:50,591
Are you not disturbed
by what we just saw?

786
01:13:50,676 --> 01:13:53,589
Yeah, of course I am.

787
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:56,843
That was really, really shocking.

788
01:13:58,267 --> 01:14:01,135
I'm trying to keep an open mind, though.

789
01:14:01,228 --> 01:14:03,436
That's cultural, you know?

790
01:14:03,522 --> 01:14:05,730
We stick our elders in nursing homes.

791
01:14:05,816 --> 01:14:08,058
I'm sure they find <i>that</i> disturbing.

792
01:14:09,570 --> 01:14:13,029
I think we really need to just
at least try to acclimate.

793
01:14:22,083 --> 01:14:26,123
Hey, do you... Sorry. Um, do you have
a sleeping pill I can take?

794
01:14:26,212 --> 01:14:28,249
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks.

795
01:14:55,241 --> 01:14:57,041
You're gonna wake her.

796
01:17:58,799 --> 01:18:00,131
Yo, Pelle.

797
01:18:15,399 --> 01:18:16,890
Whatcha doin'?

798
01:18:18,319 --> 01:18:20,151
Just working in the garden.

799
01:18:25,659 --> 01:18:27,525
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

800
01:18:27,620 --> 01:18:29,703
Any word?

801
01:18:29,788 --> 01:18:34,032
Yeah, they said you can do it as long as
you absolutely don't use any names.

802
01:18:34,126 --> 01:18:36,459
- Okay. Wow.
- Or the location is never even hinted at.

803
01:18:36,545 --> 01:18:37,911
- Okay.
- And you'll have to sign

804
01:18:38,005 --> 01:18:40,588
an agreement to that.

805
01:18:40,674 --> 01:18:45,385
And you're splitting it with Christian,
because he came to me first.

806
01:18:45,471 --> 01:18:47,804
Well, that's... We'll...
We'll figure that out.

807
01:18:47,890 --> 01:18:51,725
- I gotta go take a leak.
- Uh, here, can I ask you something?

808
01:18:51,810 --> 01:18:52,926
- Yeah.
- Uh...

809
01:18:53,020 --> 01:18:56,980
Do you know what this is?

810
01:18:57,066 --> 01:18:59,809
I found it
under Christian's bed.

811
01:18:59,902 --> 01:19:04,488
Oh. That's a love rune.
Casts a love spell.

812
01:19:04,573 --> 01:19:07,361
- A love rune. Huh.
- Yeah.

813
01:19:07,451 --> 01:19:09,613
- Under Christian's bed?
- Yeah, yeah.

814
01:19:11,997 --> 01:19:14,114
What's going on?

815
01:19:14,208 --> 01:19:16,144
Uh, the elders said
you can do your thesis

816
01:19:16,168 --> 01:19:19,536
as long as you don't use
the actual names or location.

817
01:19:19,630 --> 01:19:20,746
Are you serious?

818
01:19:20,839 --> 01:19:22,375
Yeah.

819
01:19:22,466 --> 01:19:25,174
Oh, my God, thank you, man.

820
01:19:25,261 --> 01:19:27,378
That is incredible news.
Thank you.

821
01:19:27,471 --> 01:19:28,865
You're splitting it
with Josh as well.

822
01:19:28,889 --> 01:19:31,802
Yeah, I already told him
I'm totally fine with that.

823
01:19:31,892 --> 01:19:35,431
Okay. Well, I think my sister
Maja has taken a liking to you.

824
01:19:37,189 --> 01:19:41,024
Yeah? The redhead?

825
01:19:41,110 --> 01:19:44,524
Actually, she just got
the <i>byxmyndig last year.</i>

826
01:19:45,948 --> 01:19:48,782
It basically means that,
uh, you are...

827
01:19:48,867 --> 01:19:52,702
You are allowed to have sex.
Pants license.

828
01:19:52,788 --> 01:19:54,154
- Okay. Good for her.
- Hey!

829
01:20:00,879 --> 01:20:02,040
Hey, whoa!

830
01:20:03,757 --> 01:20:06,374
What? Okay, relax. Relax!
What did I do?

831
01:20:07,553 --> 01:20:10,421
- Pelle, what is going on?
- What happened? What happened?

832
01:20:14,059 --> 01:20:15,300
What did I do? What did I do?

833
01:20:17,646 --> 01:20:18,682
Dude! Okay!

834
01:20:20,190 --> 01:20:22,056
You pissed
on the ancestral tree.

835
01:20:22,151 --> 01:20:23,733
- The tree... So what?
- Yes, yes.

836
01:20:23,819 --> 01:20:24,819
"So what?"

837
01:20:25,988 --> 01:20:27,149
- I didn't know.
- No, it's...

838
01:20:27,239 --> 01:20:29,276
That tree is tied
to all of our dead.

839
01:20:29,366 --> 01:20:31,779
It's a dead tree, though.

840
01:20:31,869 --> 01:20:33,360
- It's dead.
- Yeah, yeah, I know.

841
01:20:33,454 --> 01:20:34,661
But it's important to us.

842
01:20:34,747 --> 01:20:36,955
I just had to pee.
I didn't know it was special.

843
01:20:54,058 --> 01:20:55,219
Hey.

844
01:20:55,309 --> 01:20:57,426
Hey. It was
really nice to meet you.

845
01:20:57,519 --> 01:21:00,057
I'm so sorry.
We're actually leaving.

846
01:21:00,147 --> 01:21:01,513
What?

847
01:21:01,607 --> 01:21:03,314
- Yeah.
- Connie.

848
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:05,462
Simon is getting
the truck with one of them now.

849
01:21:05,486 --> 01:21:07,486
- Connie.
- Is everything okay?

850
01:21:08,822 --> 01:21:10,905
Connie.

851
01:21:10,991 --> 01:21:12,732
Oh, there.

852
01:21:12,826 --> 01:21:15,614
Uh, Simon,
he told me to tell you

853
01:21:15,704 --> 01:21:18,162
that, uh, Jan drove him
to the train station.

854
01:21:18,248 --> 01:21:23,289
And after, uh, Simon gets dropped off,
he's sending the truck back for you.

855
01:21:23,379 --> 01:21:27,498
- What?
- You will meet him, uh, there.

856
01:21:27,591 --> 01:21:29,253
No.

857
01:21:29,343 --> 01:21:32,586
Why would he just go without me?
He... He wouldn't do that.

858
01:21:32,679 --> 01:21:35,467
Well, the truck
only had room for two.

859
01:21:35,557 --> 01:21:37,014
So...

860
01:21:37,101 --> 01:21:39,935
What does that mean?

861
01:21:40,020 --> 01:21:42,637
That doesn't even make any sense. He would
have told me.

862
01:21:42,731 --> 01:21:45,064
Today's only train
leaves in 90 minutes.

863
01:21:45,150 --> 01:21:47,563
It takes about 35 minutes to go there
and back,

864
01:21:47,653 --> 01:21:49,815
so they didn't want to waste time.

865
01:21:49,905 --> 01:21:52,022
So I could have
sat on his lap.

866
01:21:52,116 --> 01:21:54,984
Yes, I imagined that, too, but, you know,
we...

867
01:21:55,077 --> 01:21:58,241
We don't break traffic laws.
Okay?

868
01:22:01,083 --> 01:22:02,995
So they've just gone.
They've left me just now.

869
01:22:03,085 --> 01:22:05,828
Now, Connie. There was
no room in the truck.

870
01:22:05,921 --> 01:22:09,039
Yet, it is coming right back
for you. Yeah.

871
01:22:12,761 --> 01:22:14,468
This is bullshit.

872
01:22:23,981 --> 01:22:25,973
Okay, lunch in a bit.

873
01:22:34,199 --> 01:22:37,658
And how are jobs
or roles assigned?

874
01:22:37,744 --> 01:22:40,578
That's based on traits
we show as kids.

875
01:22:40,664 --> 01:22:42,872
- Hey.
- Hey. Hi. Sorry.

876
01:22:42,958 --> 01:22:43,994
Um...

877
01:22:45,043 --> 01:22:47,751
Simon left without Connie.

878
01:22:47,838 --> 01:22:49,795
- Jesus, really?
- Yeah.

879
01:22:49,882 --> 01:22:52,295
What a dick move.

880
01:22:52,384 --> 01:22:54,376
- Is she okay?
- Uh, no.

881
01:22:54,470 --> 01:22:55,697
- She just got told.
- Did she say why?

882
01:22:55,721 --> 01:22:57,929
No, no.

883
01:22:58,015 --> 01:22:59,722
That sucks.

884
01:23:02,060 --> 01:23:06,270
On the... On the subject
of couples actually, um...

885
01:23:06,356 --> 01:23:09,064
Is there ever an issue here
with incest?

886
01:23:11,069 --> 01:23:14,608
Sorry, I mean, you know,
small communities.

887
01:23:14,698 --> 01:23:17,281
Well, the bloodlines
are very well-preserved.

888
01:23:17,367 --> 01:23:23,534
So, uh, the elders must approve mates.
Cousins can sometimes mate.

889
01:23:23,624 --> 01:23:30,042
But we do respect the incest taboo,
so we often need to invite outside people.

890
01:23:51,610 --> 01:23:53,977
Excuse me. Hey.

891
01:23:55,197 --> 01:23:57,029
Would you like
to help join us?

892
01:23:58,992 --> 01:24:01,029
Uh...

893
01:24:01,119 --> 01:24:03,827
- Sure, yeah.
- Come.

894
01:24:03,914 --> 01:24:06,782
Do you...
Do you know, um...

895
01:24:06,875 --> 01:24:09,037
Have you seen Simon anywhere?

896
01:24:09,127 --> 01:24:11,414
Yes. He was driven to the station.

897
01:24:11,505 --> 01:24:14,623
- Did you not say goodbye?
- No. No, I didn't.

898
01:24:14,716 --> 01:24:17,254
But, uh, that's okay, that's okay.

899
01:24:17,344 --> 01:24:19,210
Hi.

900
01:24:24,309 --> 01:24:27,723
- What are we making here?
- Meat tarts!

901
01:24:27,813 --> 01:24:29,600
Oh, wow.

902
01:24:29,690 --> 01:24:31,522
Oh, thank you.

903
01:24:33,735 --> 01:24:36,148
She said you're so beautiful.

904
01:24:36,238 --> 01:24:40,699
Oh, thank you.
Um, she's so beautiful.

905
01:24:44,204 --> 01:24:47,823
We describe it like emotional sheet music.

906
01:24:47,916 --> 01:24:49,623
Hmm. What does it say?

907
01:24:49,710 --> 01:24:55,251
Well, each runic letter stands for one
of the 16 affects,

908
01:24:55,340 --> 01:24:59,084
which are graded
from most holy to most unholy.

909
01:24:59,177 --> 01:25:01,590
This one, for example, is about grief.

910
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:02,680
Hmm.

911
01:25:02,764 --> 01:25:06,974
You can see at the end, however,
we have blank pages.

912
01:25:08,020 --> 01:25:12,685
This is because the <i>Rubi Radr
is a work forever in progress.</i>

913
01:25:12,774 --> 01:25:13,890
Forever evolving.

914
01:25:13,984 --> 01:25:18,228
We have many,
many hundreds of these.

915
01:25:18,322 --> 01:25:22,316
And who decides
what gets added?

916
01:25:22,409 --> 01:25:26,904
Well, uh, this iteration
is being written by Rubin.

917
01:25:29,750 --> 01:25:34,666
- Uh, the disabled?
- Since birth.

918
01:25:34,755 --> 01:25:39,170
He draws and we, the elders, interpret.

919
01:25:40,677 --> 01:25:45,297
You see, Josh, Rubin is unclouded
by normal cognition.

920
01:25:45,390 --> 01:25:48,929
It makes him open for the source.

921
01:25:49,019 --> 01:25:55,311
Uh, what happens when Rubin dies?

922
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:59,189
Do you just wait for a baby that is...

923
01:26:00,322 --> 01:26:01,403
not clouded?

924
01:26:01,490 --> 01:26:06,360
No, no, no.
Uh, Rubin was a product of inbreeding.

925
01:26:06,453 --> 01:26:11,073
All of our Oracles are
deliberate products of inbreeding.

926
01:26:14,419 --> 01:26:15,830
Can I take a photograph?

927
01:26:17,255 --> 01:26:20,293
- What?
- Uh, a photograph?

928
01:26:20,384 --> 01:26:23,968
- No! Absolutely not.
- Okay, sorry.

929
01:26:24,054 --> 01:26:26,421
Absolutely not.

930
01:26:51,373 --> 01:26:53,490
Oh, fuck, yep, that's her.

931
01:27:00,799 --> 01:27:02,415
Hey.

932
01:27:09,474 --> 01:27:11,887
Oh, great. She's walking away.

933
01:27:31,997 --> 01:27:33,533
Thank you.

934
01:27:40,172 --> 01:27:42,710
Thanks.

935
01:27:42,799 --> 01:27:44,165
Thanks.

936
01:27:50,056 --> 01:27:53,845
Has anyone seen Connie?

937
01:27:53,935 --> 01:27:56,427
I think Mark saw her earlier.

938
01:27:56,521 --> 01:27:59,434
I'm sure I saw her trying out
for the sprinting Olympics earlier.

939
01:27:59,524 --> 01:28:02,733
- What? Where?
- Sorry, but I can say what happened.

940
01:28:02,819 --> 01:28:04,088
Her boyfriend called the landline

941
01:28:04,112 --> 01:28:06,320
from the train station
and calmed Connie down.

942
01:28:06,406 --> 01:28:09,319
Then she begged our pardon
and I drove her to meet him.

943
01:28:12,829 --> 01:28:16,789
- Okay, well, that's a relief.
- Why would Simon leave without her?

944
01:28:18,043 --> 01:28:20,126
I'm sure it was just
a miscommunication.

945
01:28:37,395 --> 01:28:39,557
I could see you
possibly doing that.

946
01:28:44,694 --> 01:28:46,310
What the hell does that mean?

947
01:28:52,369 --> 01:28:53,610
Never mind.

948
01:29:00,544 --> 01:29:03,503
Someone's still sore
about their ancestral tree.

949
01:29:09,302 --> 01:29:11,009
Dude, is he going to kill me?

950
01:29:14,140 --> 01:29:16,507
Did you learn anything
about the <i>Rubi Radr?</i>

951
01:29:22,691 --> 01:29:25,525
- Oh, so now you wanna collaborate?
- Okay, thank you.

952
01:29:25,610 --> 01:29:27,567
I know that one elder
gave you a glimpse of it.

953
01:29:27,654 --> 01:29:29,441
Thank you. Sorry I brought it up.

954
01:29:53,680 --> 01:29:56,718
Oh, my God, dude.
What the fuck?

955
01:29:56,808 --> 01:29:58,424
- Is that...
- What is that?

956
01:29:58,518 --> 01:30:00,384
- Is that a fucking pube?
- Ew.

957
01:30:00,478 --> 01:30:01,559
It's just a hair.

958
01:30:01,646 --> 01:30:03,558
Yeah, a pubic hair.

959
01:30:03,648 --> 01:30:06,561
- Dude, calm down.
- Why are you embarrassed?

960
01:30:06,651 --> 01:30:09,485
You're not the one
giving out hair pies.

961
01:30:29,215 --> 01:30:32,083
Jesus Christ. He's still
fucking lookin' at me.

962
01:30:32,177 --> 01:30:35,841
Hey. You'll come with me?

963
01:30:35,931 --> 01:30:38,173
- What?
- You'll come?

964
01:30:38,266 --> 01:30:41,600
- Uh... Okay, sure.
- I'll show you.

965
01:30:41,686 --> 01:30:43,928
- Yeah?
- Yeah, great.

966
01:30:44,022 --> 01:30:48,392
Um... I'll be back. I guess
she's gonna show me.

967
01:31:11,466 --> 01:31:13,583
Hey, can I, uh,
borrow another sleeping pill?

968
01:31:13,677 --> 01:31:15,418
- Yeah, sure, yeah.
- Thanks.

969
01:31:18,098 --> 01:31:19,305
Thank you.

970
01:33:08,041 --> 01:33:10,624
What the fuck, Mark?

971
01:33:10,710 --> 01:33:12,354
What the fuck are you doing?
Close the door!

972
01:33:12,378 --> 01:33:13,698
We're not supposed to be in here.

973
01:34:11,354 --> 01:34:14,392
Do you think Mark's
still up with that girl?

974
01:34:14,482 --> 01:34:16,018
I wouldn't be surprised.

975
01:34:19,154 --> 01:34:20,486
What about Josh though?

976
01:34:20,572 --> 01:34:22,859
I'm honestly
not too concerned.

977
01:34:24,117 --> 01:34:25,983
Well.

978
01:34:26,077 --> 01:34:31,823
We, um, have something regretful
to announce.

979
01:34:31,916 --> 01:34:35,535
This morning
the 19th Book of <i>Rubi Radr</i>

980
01:34:35,628 --> 01:34:37,665
was found missing from the Temple.

981
01:34:39,424 --> 01:34:42,292
We don't want to point fingers,

982
01:34:42,385 --> 01:34:46,720
yet, we kindly ask that whoever took it
to return it to its original place.

983
01:34:46,806 --> 01:34:48,547
You can leave it in the Temple,

984
01:34:48,641 --> 01:34:51,509
<i>which will be left unguarded,
unwatched.</i>

985
01:34:51,603 --> 01:34:54,767
<i>Nobody needs to know it was you.</i>

986
01:35:07,452 --> 01:35:12,664
- Where is your friend, Josh?
- I know. Uh, we have no idea.

987
01:35:12,749 --> 01:35:18,086
He and your other friend,
they both disappears the same day.

988
01:35:19,714 --> 01:35:21,314
- You see how it looks?
- Yes, obviously.

989
01:35:21,382 --> 01:35:23,465
But I swear to you,
we're in the dark on this.

990
01:35:23,551 --> 01:35:25,508
We're just as confused as you are.

991
01:35:26,971 --> 01:35:29,258
We did see Mark go off
with that girl last night.

992
01:35:30,266 --> 01:35:32,223
- What girl?
- Inge.

993
01:35:32,310 --> 01:35:33,926
Yeah, but Mark
wouldn't have done this.

994
01:35:34,020 --> 01:35:35,761
Josh, on the other hand,

995
01:35:35,855 --> 01:35:38,438
he came to bed with us
and when we woke up, he was gone.

996
01:35:38,524 --> 01:35:41,107
And if he did take that book,
I just pray you understand

997
01:35:41,194 --> 01:35:45,529
we don't associate as friends of his or
collaborators or anything.

998
01:35:45,615 --> 01:35:47,231
We would just be so embarrassed

999
01:35:47,325 --> 01:35:51,490
to be connected to this
in any way, shape or form.

1000
01:35:51,579 --> 01:35:55,994
- Let's hope it gets returned.
- I hope so too.

1001
01:35:56,084 --> 01:35:58,041
I feel responsible.

1002
01:35:58,127 --> 01:36:00,995
Well, you and Odd,
you can go looking for them.

1003
01:36:01,089 --> 01:36:03,331
- Yes.
- Maybe you can redeem this.

1004
01:36:04,968 --> 01:36:08,507
You are going with the women
for the day's activity.

1005
01:36:08,596 --> 01:36:10,007
Oh, hi.

1006
01:36:10,098 --> 01:36:13,091
And, uh, Siv wants to see you
in her house.

1007
01:36:20,900 --> 01:36:23,108
- You okay?
- Mm-hmm.

1008
01:36:23,194 --> 01:36:24,560
Okay.

1009
01:36:25,863 --> 01:36:27,354
Okay.

1010
01:37:08,239 --> 01:37:09,605
This is the big one.

1011
01:37:09,699 --> 01:37:12,407
Okay. Thank you.

1012
01:37:16,205 --> 01:37:19,369
- Look into her eyes.
- Mm-hmm.

1013
01:37:19,459 --> 01:37:22,998
Um, can I ask
what this is exactly?

1014
01:37:23,087 --> 01:37:27,252
It's, um...
tea for the competition.

1015
01:37:32,472 --> 01:37:35,761
- And then you, glass here.
- Mm-hmm.

1016
01:37:37,727 --> 01:37:39,184
And then we drink it.

1017
01:37:39,270 --> 01:37:41,603
- Okay?
- Okay.

1018
01:37:41,689 --> 01:37:42,725
Okay.

1019
01:37:47,320 --> 01:37:48,481
Mm-hmm?

1020
01:37:49,739 --> 01:37:51,071
Uh-oh!

1021
01:37:51,157 --> 01:37:53,524
- Oh, God.
- Here we go!

1022
01:37:53,618 --> 01:37:54,950
Mmm.

1023
01:39:55,656 --> 01:39:57,443
Please. Come in.

1024
01:40:50,503 --> 01:40:54,247
First thing I just have to say,
I have no idea where Josh is.

1025
01:40:54,340 --> 01:40:56,502
And I can swear to that
on my mother's life.

1026
01:40:56,592 --> 01:40:58,584
How do you feel about Maja?

1027
01:41:03,140 --> 01:41:04,597
About Maja?

1028
01:41:10,022 --> 01:41:12,810
How do I
feel about her how?

1029
01:41:12,900 --> 01:41:15,893
You have been approved
to mate with her.

1030
01:41:15,987 --> 01:41:19,822
You're an ideal
astrological match.

1031
01:41:19,907 --> 01:41:22,570
And she has
fixed her hopes on you.

1032
01:41:29,041 --> 01:41:32,034
I think I ate
one of her pubic hairs.

1033
01:41:32,128 --> 01:41:34,085
Sounds probably right.

1034
01:42:15,796 --> 01:42:17,253
Stop!

1035
01:42:23,679 --> 01:42:25,716
Stay here.

1036
01:42:25,806 --> 01:42:27,451
Are you ready?

1037
01:42:27,475 --> 01:42:29,717
- What are we doing?
- You'll see.

1038
01:43:39,797 --> 01:43:42,505
Stop!

1039
01:43:45,886 --> 01:43:47,072
- You're so good!
- What does that mean?

1040
01:43:47,096 --> 01:43:48,156
- You're so good!
- What does that mean?

1041
01:43:48,180 --> 01:43:49,180
Eight! Eight!

1042
01:43:49,265 --> 01:43:50,450
- There are eight left.
- What?

1043
01:44:15,750 --> 01:44:16,750
Uh...

1044
01:44:16,834 --> 01:44:19,872
- For you.
- Uh...

1045
01:44:19,962 --> 01:44:22,545
Thanks.

1046
01:44:22,631 --> 01:44:24,418
- What is it?
- Um...

1047
01:44:24,508 --> 01:44:26,249
It's... Sorry.

1048
01:44:27,636 --> 01:44:32,927
Spring water
with special properties.

1049
01:44:33,017 --> 01:44:34,303
Oh.

1050
01:44:34,393 --> 01:44:37,227
Okay.

1051
01:44:37,313 --> 01:44:39,680
- Okay.
- What does it do?

1052
01:44:39,774 --> 01:44:41,436
Oh, um...

1053
01:44:41,525 --> 01:44:45,485
It, uh... It breaks down your defenses

1054
01:44:45,571 --> 01:44:50,236
and opens you for the influence.

1055
01:44:50,326 --> 01:44:53,034
Okay.

1056
01:44:53,120 --> 01:44:55,077
Thanks.

1057
01:44:55,164 --> 01:44:57,622
You're welcome.

1058
01:44:57,708 --> 01:45:01,418
You know what? Um... I'm worried
I'll have a bad trip.

1059
01:45:01,504 --> 01:45:05,248
Oh, no, no. You won't.
You won't. Trust me.

1060
01:46:48,444 --> 01:46:51,027
- I don't speak Swedish.
- What?

1061
01:47:19,558 --> 01:47:22,972
What? What?

1062
01:47:30,444 --> 01:47:32,026
What's happening?

1063
01:47:34,073 --> 01:47:38,067
You are our May Queen.

1064
01:47:38,160 --> 01:47:39,651
- Me?
- Yes!

1065
01:47:39,745 --> 01:47:42,453
- Why?
- You won!

1066
01:47:42,539 --> 01:47:44,030
What does that mean?

1067
01:47:44,124 --> 01:47:45,615
What? Oh.

1068
01:48:35,467 --> 01:48:37,459
Mom? Mom?

1069
01:48:39,221 --> 01:48:42,339
Oh, my God, Dani! May Queen!

1070
01:51:20,507 --> 01:51:22,920
- Herring?
- What for?

1071
01:51:24,428 --> 01:51:28,388
- It's tradition. For good luck.
- Yeah.

1072
01:51:28,473 --> 01:51:31,261
- What?
- And you must eat it whole.

1073
01:51:31,351 --> 01:51:33,843
- But the tails go in first.
- No, no, no!

1074
01:51:33,937 --> 01:51:35,769
You must try!

1075
01:51:35,856 --> 01:51:37,597
- You must try!
- Ahhh!

1076
01:51:48,202 --> 01:51:50,410
Very good try.

1077
01:51:53,332 --> 01:51:56,075
Excuse me...

1078
01:51:56,168 --> 01:51:58,831
What's going on?

1079
01:52:06,303 --> 01:52:08,260
Why did you do that?

1080
01:52:15,062 --> 01:52:18,305
To our May Queen!

1081
01:52:20,317 --> 01:52:22,274
<i>Skal!</i>

1082
01:52:34,248 --> 01:52:36,114
You are the family now! Yes?

1083
01:52:36,208 --> 01:52:40,327
Yes, you are the family.
Like sisters.

1084
01:53:53,035 --> 01:53:56,244
Your dance was amazing.

1085
01:53:56,330 --> 01:53:58,913
I've never seen someone
dance like that.

1086
01:54:12,179 --> 01:54:17,516
Now, it's traditional for the May Queen
to bless our crops and livestock.

1087
01:54:19,061 --> 01:54:22,975
And after the luck you just inherited from
that salt herring,

1088
01:54:23,065 --> 01:54:25,603
we should all be
doubly encouraged.

1089
01:54:39,206 --> 01:54:40,947
Can Christian
come with me?

1090
01:54:41,041 --> 01:54:44,500
Nay. The Queen must ride alone.

1091
01:57:19,824 --> 01:57:22,692
Repeat after me.

1092
01:58:07,789 --> 01:58:11,282
Breathe in.

1093
01:58:11,376 --> 01:58:13,959
For your vitality.

1094
02:02:38,142 --> 02:02:40,509
We shall go now
to Siv's house.

1095
02:02:40,603 --> 02:02:41,810
What's this?

1096
02:02:41,896 --> 02:02:44,889
It is a special meeting,
only for the Queens.

1097
02:02:44,983 --> 02:02:46,394
And she will bless you.

1098
02:02:50,196 --> 02:02:53,280
- What's that?
- That's not for us.

1099
02:02:58,621 --> 02:03:00,237
I think you should not.

1100
02:04:49,190 --> 02:04:51,307
No, no, no.

1101
02:09:42,525 --> 02:09:44,642
Christian?

1102
02:09:44,735 --> 02:09:46,977
Christian.

1103
02:09:49,573 --> 02:09:50,654
Hi.

1104
02:09:52,326 --> 02:09:54,784
Hello, there you are.

1105
02:09:54,870 --> 02:09:56,406
Listen.

1106
02:09:56,497 --> 02:10:00,537
You can't speak.
You can't move.

1107
02:10:00,626 --> 02:10:04,165
All right? Good.

1108
02:10:14,390 --> 02:10:19,510
On this, the day
of our deity of reciprocity,

1109
02:10:19,603 --> 02:10:24,143
we gather to give special thanks
to our treasured sun.

1110
02:10:25,151 --> 02:10:27,643
As an offering to our father,

1111
02:10:27,737 --> 02:10:31,981
we will today surrender
nine human lives.

1112
02:10:33,326 --> 02:10:37,821
As Harga takes,
so Harga also gives.

1113
02:10:37,913 --> 02:10:42,578
Thus, for every
new blood sacrificed,

1114
02:10:42,668 --> 02:10:46,161
we will dedicate
one of our own.

1115
02:10:47,214 --> 02:10:50,958
That is four new bloods.

1116
02:10:51,052 --> 02:10:53,635
Four from Harga.

1117
02:10:53,721 --> 02:10:56,964
And one to be chosen
by the Queen.

1118
02:10:57,058 --> 02:11:03,806
Nine in all to die and be reborn
in the great cycle.

1119
02:11:05,107 --> 02:11:09,101
The four new bloods
have already been supplied.

1120
02:11:09,195 --> 02:11:13,485
As for our end, we have two
already dedicated...

1121
02:11:17,119 --> 02:11:20,487
and two who have volunteered.

1122
02:11:20,581 --> 02:11:23,449
Ingemar and Ulf.

1123
02:11:26,796 --> 02:11:30,380
You have brought
outside offerings.

1124
02:11:30,466 --> 02:11:33,334
Plus volunteering
your own bodies.

1125
02:11:34,512 --> 02:11:38,631
You will today be joined
in harmony with everything.

1126
02:11:40,059 --> 02:11:46,602
And to Pelle, who has brought new blood
and our new May Queen,

1127
02:11:46,690 --> 02:11:50,559
you will today be honored
for your unclouded intuition.

1128
02:11:51,862 --> 02:11:55,526
And so,
for our ninth offering...

1129
02:11:56,784 --> 02:12:00,118
it is traditional that
our fair Queen shall choose

1130
02:12:00,204 --> 02:12:05,541
between a preselected new blood
and a specially-ordained Hargan.

1131
02:12:32,111 --> 02:12:33,647
Turbeyon.

1132
02:12:34,655 --> 02:12:37,989
Honorable Turbeyon!
Please step forward.

1133
02:12:42,621 --> 02:12:43,782
And...

1134
02:13:02,433 --> 02:13:04,265
Christian Hughes.

1135
02:13:07,438 --> 02:13:11,648
These are the candidates
for the ninth and final offering.

1136
02:13:13,194 --> 02:13:16,312
We patiently await
your verdict.
