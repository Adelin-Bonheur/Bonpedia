2
00:04:33,369 --> 00:04:35,962
Now reaching the right side of the colic.

3
00:04:38,119 --> 00:04:40,234
That looks pretty clean.

4
00:04:42,002 --> 00:04:46,364
An inferior ileocecal valve,
which is patent and looks fine.

5
00:04:48,776 --> 00:04:50,618
Prep looks good.

6
00:04:51,274 --> 00:04:53,885
Looks like he's well-cleaned out.

7
00:04:56,387 --> 00:04:58,952
Going up to sigmoid colon.

8
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:02,640
Few scattered diverticula there.

9
00:05:06,563 --> 00:05:09,316
Heading towards a splenic flectional.

10
00:05:10,825 --> 00:05:13,063
That looks clean.

11
00:05:15,687 --> 00:05:17,637
In a transverse colon.

12
00:05:17,637 --> 00:05:21,743
Wait a second,
that looks like a flat polyp there.

13
00:05:21,894 --> 00:05:23,988
Probably about 2 cm.

14
00:05:25,614 --> 00:05:28,256
Infix and biopsy for that.

15
00:05:28,332 --> 00:05:30,952
- Yussi, I'm a block away.
- Where the fuck are you, man?

16
00:05:31,158 --> 00:05:34,087
- I told you I'm walking already, I'm walking.
- I got 2 guys, they said they gonna be watching

17
00:05:34,087 --> 00:05:35,572
at their system holding,
what the fuck is going on?

18
00:05:35,572 --> 00:05:36,325
Hey there, man?!

19
00:05:36,325 --> 00:05:37,958
- I got client, tell them to leave.
- Who the fuck do you think you are talking to?

20
00:05:38,055 --> 00:05:39,633
I don't think you said 
they're friends of Arno’s.

21
00:05:39,633 --> 00:05:41,549
- Arno?! Tell 'em I’m coming up now.

22
00:05:41,893 --> 00:05:43,780
Bobby, I need that.

23
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:56,310
30 inches, that's like about
35 carats in that.

24
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:03,634
And bright in the middle gem...

25
00:06:04,335 --> 00:06:06,430
Yo, Howie!
What's poppin', man?

26
00:06:06,642 --> 00:06:09,103
That's my nigga Ca$h Out
I was telling you about.

27
00:06:09,198 --> 00:06:10,266
I'm gonna cash out.

28
00:06:10,266 --> 00:06:12,179
- How do you feel, all right?
- No, it was good.

29
00:06:12,179 --> 00:06:13,543
They are calling me
with the results.

30
00:06:13,543 --> 00:06:14,831
Hey, give him
some face time, man.

31
00:06:14,831 --> 00:06:16,022
- Hi, how are you?
- I'm good man.

32
00:06:16,022 --> 00:06:18,629
- Congratulations.
- Trying to spend some money with you.

33
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:21,253
He took me from Flawless, man,
to come spend some money with you.

34
00:06:21,342 --> 00:06:22,665
He's telling me
you got the best prices.

35
00:06:22,665 --> 00:06:25,945
He’s doing you a favor, believe me,
that guy is a, fucking, moron.

36
00:06:25,945 --> 00:06:28,645
Yeah, Arno's friends here?
Yeah, I'm...

37
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,181
Yussi told me you were waiting on me,
so I'm sorry about that.

38
00:06:32,181 --> 00:06:33,911
 - I'm Howard.
- Phil.

39
00:06:33,911 --> 00:06:35,608
You didn’t bring them any water?

40
00:06:35,608 --> 00:06:36,751
I'm good on the water.

41
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:39,087
I don't really need water,
thank you anyway.

42
00:06:39,731 --> 00:06:42,268
This is our own spring water.

43
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:45,294
We’re the first on the block 
to have that.

44
00:06:46,316 --> 00:06:48,631
- Your parents happy for ya?
- Yeah, yeah.

45
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:52,005
All right, so...
I'm gonna tell you I'm in a bit of a rush.

46
00:06:52,005 --> 00:06:54,042
I don’t have much time,
because I gotta get...

47
00:06:54,042 --> 00:06:56,484
What did I tell you?
I said no water.

48
00:06:56,709 --> 00:06:58,320
Didn’t I tell you no water?

49
00:06:58,331 --> 00:07:01,293
I think it’s in your best interest
that you find some time for you and I.

50
00:07:01,293 --> 00:07:02,171
Let me get here, a second.

51
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:04,927
- All right, we’re on the same page, right?
- We are on the same page.

52
00:07:04,927 --> 00:07:07,219
- You all right, Howard?
- Oh yeah. 100% fine.

53
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:09,219
Let's go, I'll handle it.
I'll handle it.

54
00:07:09,627 --> 00:07:11,767
You don't do that here, sir.

55
00:07:17,457 --> 00:07:18,915
Pick that door.

56
00:07:26,552 --> 00:07:28,263
Arno Maredian.

57
00:07:28,263 --> 00:07:29,481
- He's not available.
- Okay, all right.

58
00:07:29,481 --> 00:07:31,415
- He's not answering.
- He knows you are calling.

59
00:07:31,415 --> 00:07:32,824
He doesn't want
to deal with you anymore.

60
00:07:32,824 --> 00:07:35,233
- I understand, give me 1 more day.
- No, I don't think you do.

61
00:07:35,353 --> 00:07:38,013
Stop the fucking soap opera!
Listen, listen. Enough.

62
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,145
What are we doing?
What the fuck is...

63
00:07:40,145 --> 00:07:41,678
Here we go again.
Stop fighting it.

64
00:07:41,678 --> 00:07:43,307
- It is not necessarily.
- No, it isn't?

65
00:07:43,307 --> 00:07:45,361
Well, we'll be the judges of it.

66
00:07:46,116 --> 00:07:48,742
- Literally, my last amount of cash I got.
- Fucking magician.

67
00:07:48,928 --> 00:07:51,345
- What about this? What's this?
- This is not mine.

68
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:52,961
- But it's not mine.
- Take the fuck off.

69
00:07:52,961 --> 00:07:55,196
Take the, fucking, watch.
Take it. Take it.

70
00:07:57,468 --> 00:07:59,406
Arno Maredian.

71
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:02,489
Arno, what the fuck is this shit?

72
00:08:02,489 --> 00:08:05,509
You're sending collectors
to fuck with me at my office?!

73
00:08:05,509 --> 00:08:07,675
Are you out of your, fucking, mind?

74
00:08:07,842 --> 00:08:11,893
I'm, literally, minutes away from
closing the biggest deal of my, goddamn, life.

75
00:08:11,893 --> 00:08:14,097
And when I do
you gonna be embarrassed.

76
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:20,067
And by the way, the watch they took from me,
it's worth 20 000 dollars.

77
00:08:20,067 --> 00:08:23,441
I want that deducted
from the hundred grand, you understand?

78
00:08:23,441 --> 00:08:24,661
Call me back!

79
00:08:31,182 --> 00:08:33,635
What's up, ladies?

80
00:08:33,949 --> 00:08:36,205
- She's sleeping.
- She is sleeping?

81
00:08:51,103 --> 00:08:52,554
This is bullshit!

82
00:08:52,568 --> 00:08:54,229
- Hey Howie.
- Hey, Howard, how are you?

83
00:08:54,229 --> 00:08:55,838
People coming in and out
of the apartment.

84
00:08:55,838 --> 00:08:57,116
Oh my God, not this...

85
00:08:57,116 --> 00:08:59,085
You show up to work
anytime you, damn, please?

86
00:08:59,213 --> 00:09:01,540
- Howard I was working all night.
- I'm sick of this shit.

87
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:04,438
- You're taking advantage of me.
- Howard. Oh my God.

88
00:09:04,438 --> 00:09:07,456
- Come on.
- It's 10:30. It's time to wake up.

89
00:09:07,623 --> 00:09:09,042
You're just so extra.

90
00:09:09,042 --> 00:09:11,605
- Did you have a party last night?
- I did not have a party.

91
00:09:11,605 --> 00:09:13,457
Did we have a party?
That was not a party...

92
00:09:13,457 --> 00:09:16,059
- Why didn't you call me?
- Okay, because I did call you.

93
00:09:16,186 --> 00:09:19,046
At around 9:30,
you said, "I'll call you back in 5".

94
00:09:19,046 --> 00:09:21,708
- I waited for hours.
- Yes, because I fell asleep.

95
00:09:21,986 --> 00:09:23,454
I was putting Beni to sleep.

96
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,471
- Here we go with the lies.
- I had to put him to sleep.

97
00:09:25,471 --> 00:09:26,858
- I'm not lying!
- You're so manipulative!

98
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:29,929
I had to fall asleep on the floor again!
I'm exhausted!

99
00:09:30,053 --> 00:09:32,969
I didn't ask you to have kids.
Not my fault you have kids.

100
00:09:32,969 --> 00:09:35,273
Shut the fuck up with that!

101
00:09:35,273 --> 00:09:38,509
Look, do you wanna, fucking, stay mad,
or do you wanna get in bed and cuddle?

102
00:09:38,709 --> 00:09:40,710
I know you wanna cuddle, Howard.
Just come here.

103
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:42,824
- Come on.
- Come on. Just come here.

104
00:09:42,824 --> 00:09:45,293
Come here baby. 
Come on, Howie.

105
00:09:45,426 --> 00:09:47,293
Come on. 
I know you wanna come here.

106
00:09:47,293 --> 00:09:50,429
- I’m so goddamn stressed out.
- I know you can't resist me.

107
00:09:50,429 --> 00:09:52,429
I know you can't resist me.

108
00:09:55,408 --> 00:09:57,937
Don't, don't.
You can't just do that.

109
00:09:57,937 --> 00:10:00,044
It's just me.
It's me, it's me.

110
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:02,153
Don’t you wanna
see the photos I took?

111
00:10:02,153 --> 00:10:04,486
Yes, yeah, show me.
What was that you...

112
00:10:04,751 --> 00:10:07,779
I took these pictures.
I think I really have a future in it.

113
00:10:07,849 --> 00:10:09,172
- How much did you get?
- 3 500.

114
00:10:09,172 --> 00:10:10,384
And who is this guy?

115
00:10:10,384 --> 00:10:12,028
It's this guy - <i>The Weeknd</i>.

116
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,415
What the fuck is <i>The Weeknd</i>?

117
00:10:13,415 --> 00:10:15,422
He's gonna be major,
even though he's from Canada.

118
00:10:15,422 --> 00:10:17,044
This guy looks stupid.

119
00:10:21,521 --> 00:10:22,531
Hi.

120
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,236
Howard Ratner.
I'm all righty.

121
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:29,253
I have a piece.
You know this kid - The Weeknd?

122
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:32,316
That's Michael Jackson there on the cross.

123
00:10:32,316 --> 00:10:35,429
It's gonna be controversial piece,
makes it more valuable.

124
00:10:35,938 --> 00:10:38,204
The blacks are RS2, that's platinum.

125
00:10:38,276 --> 00:10:40,595
Turn around.
Don't even step in my place.

126
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:41,582
Turn around.

127
00:10:41,582 --> 00:10:43,463
- I got some bets! 24 Gs.
- Don't even sit down!

128
00:10:43,463 --> 00:10:45,659
24 Gs?
Where would you get 24 Gs?

129
00:10:45,659 --> 00:10:49,085
I want the OKC/Lakers.
I want the fucking over, all right?

130
00:10:49,085 --> 00:10:50,773
I want Kobe's under.

131
00:10:50,841 --> 00:10:53,306
Kobe under?
He can’t throw it in the ocean.

132
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:57,309
He's not scoring tonight.
I want the Sixers to cover.

133
00:10:57,309 --> 00:10:58,072
Plus 1.

134
00:10:58,072 --> 00:10:59,930
- The points are...
- Let's finish the bets here.

135
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:01,394
Hey, one thing at a time!

136
00:11:01,539 --> 00:11:02,939
- I mean, come on!
- Hang on to these points.

137
00:11:03,056 --> 00:11:03,818
Demany. Demany.

138
00:11:03,818 --> 00:11:05,598
KG said he's gonna be here in a bit.

139
00:11:06,215 --> 00:11:09,017
If he gets to the store before I do,
you just fucking keep him there.

140
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:10,986
Okay? You promise me?

141
00:11:12,751 --> 00:11:16,129
Kevin Garnett is coming to
my, fucking, show room right now.

142
00:11:16,261 --> 00:11:17,475
Right now!

143
00:11:19,382 --> 00:11:21,097
We hot every right
to, fucking, be here!

144
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,243
- Get the fuck out!
- Fuck you!

145
00:11:24,162 --> 00:11:25,504
Whoah, whoah, whoah!

146
00:11:27,566 --> 00:11:29,817
Get out! Get the fuck out!

147
00:11:31,329 --> 00:11:32,966
- What?
- Fuck you man!

148
00:11:33,093 --> 00:11:35,087
You just got involved with something
you shouldn't got involved in.

149
00:11:35,087 --> 00:11:36,737
What the fuck
is going on out here?

150
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:38,411
It's on you.
You asshole!

151
00:11:38,411 --> 00:11:40,900
- You see this?
- I don't know these fucking guys!

152
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,900
You're dead fucker.
You're dead!

153
00:11:42,903 --> 00:11:44,240
You think I'm playing games?

154
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,954
Get your laughs off now, asshole.

155
00:11:46,027 --> 00:11:47,231
I didn't do nothing!

156
00:11:47,231 --> 00:11:49,368
When I’m shoveling the dirt
over your fucking head,

157
00:11:49,368 --> 00:11:51,052
we’ll see how funny it is then!

158
00:11:51,142 --> 00:11:53,310
I have clients in the office, Howard.
This is crazy!

159
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:54,323
Turn around and walk away!

160
00:11:54,323 --> 00:11:55,706
We're good.
We're good, all right?

161
00:11:55,706 --> 00:11:57,725
David, go back inside.
Everything's fine.

162
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,163
Turn around and walk away!

163
00:11:59,163 --> 00:12:00,325
That's my shop.

164
00:12:00,325 --> 00:12:01,557
Everybody back in it.

165
00:12:01,557 --> 00:12:03,504
Hello, open the door.

166
00:12:04,013 --> 00:12:07,381
Okay, Jesus fucking...
Are you with KG?

167
00:12:10,947 --> 00:12:14,260
Okay, you gotta shut that door.
It's KG, huh?

168
00:12:15,063 --> 00:12:16,214
Is that closed?

169
00:12:17,289 --> 00:12:19,378
- That's my man!
- It's insane they just...

170
00:12:20,147 --> 00:12:21,215
Howard! Howard!

171
00:12:21,215 --> 00:12:22,716
What the fuck is going on, man?

172
00:12:22,882 --> 00:12:24,656
They tried to fuck Yussi up.

173
00:12:24,656 --> 00:12:25,483
It's all set.

174
00:12:25,483 --> 00:12:27,433
Look at his, fucking, shirt!
Look at his shirt.

175
00:12:27,433 --> 00:12:28,661
Okay.

176
00:12:29,589 --> 00:12:32,617
Listen, hey, thanks for the security,
by the way.

177
00:12:32,743 --> 00:12:36,834
Send those bitches back
to Paramus or Bay Ridge.

178
00:12:37,035 --> 00:12:38,939
Would you take that 
and charge it up for me?

179
00:12:38,939 --> 00:12:41,752
All I got is, fucking, 
Yussi to protect me.

180
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,085
Let us talk.

181
00:12:45,594 --> 00:12:47,594
- What's going on, bro?
- What's up?

182
00:12:47,917 --> 00:12:50,265
Did a Maria, fucking,
time on the clock?

183
00:12:50,265 --> 00:12:51,581
Come on, not time
on the clock.

184
00:12:56,452 --> 00:12:58,013
- I like the earrings.
- Like these?

185
00:12:58,013 --> 00:12:59,515
- Those look great.
- Just come in to check on...

186
00:12:59,515 --> 00:13:01,480
- What was the last time you cleaned them?
- What are you talking about?

187
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,327
- Let me clean these for you.
- He can clean them really quick.

188
00:13:03,327 --> 00:13:05,580
Let me throw them in the ultrasonic
for you, for free.

189
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,457
- What this gonna cost me?
- For free.

190
00:13:07,457 --> 00:13:08,949
For free, for real?
Sure.

191
00:13:09,334 --> 00:13:11,334
I wouldn't think
you are that big on Roxon.

192
00:13:11,452 --> 00:13:13,158
That's 'cause you're big guy.

193
00:13:13,273 --> 00:13:14,668
Okay.

194
00:13:15,263 --> 00:13:17,698
Who would win in a fight:
Ben Wallace or Tony Allen?

195
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:21,242
- Oh, shit, take a look at that shit.
- What is that?

196
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:24,049
What is that, Gremlin?

197
00:13:24,049 --> 00:13:25,464
You got an iced-out Gremlin?

198
00:13:25,464 --> 00:13:27,831
This tardy motherfucker
right here is little fucking animal,

199
00:13:27,831 --> 00:13:30,083
or some kind of fucking...
Some toy and some shit...

200
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:31,680
And it’ll just bling the bitch out!

201
00:13:31,965 --> 00:13:34,428
He used to work with niggas
on early music videos, all that shit.

202
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,069
He's, like, the first 
nigga to start all that.

203
00:13:36,069 --> 00:13:37,943
- Are you serious?
- I started this shit.

204
00:13:37,943 --> 00:13:39,464
- Show him the fucking eyes.
- I started...

205
00:13:39,824 --> 00:13:42,834
All right. So I did this.
So it fucks with you!

206
00:13:42,977 --> 00:13:44,759
- So it fucks with you!
- Are you serious?

207
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:46,947
You like that?
There it is, there it is.

208
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:51,961
That scares the shit out of people.
Look at that.

209
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,680
Old, but It's dope.

210
00:13:53,714 --> 00:13:57,387
Listen. This shit was slammin'.

211
00:13:57,949 --> 00:14:00,510
What the link on that?
Let me see the chain on that.

212
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:03,056
That's an 18.
But I can get you a 40.

213
00:14:03,507 --> 00:14:06,291
KG, Doc know 
you’re here by the way?

214
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:08,421
No, he doesn't.
And let's keep it that way.

215
00:14:08,421 --> 00:14:11,614
It's game night,
you should be stretching out.

216
00:14:11,776 --> 00:14:13,071
What is he, your coach?

217
00:14:13,071 --> 00:14:15,515
Nah, he’s just a crazy ass Jew.

218
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,509
Throw these in the ultrasonic.

219
00:14:18,564 --> 00:14:20,592
Yes, boss, as soon as
the other stuff is done.

220
00:14:20,592 --> 00:14:21,614
No. Now!

221
00:14:22,137 --> 00:14:23,906
KG, I wouldn’t lean on that.

222
00:14:24,044 --> 00:14:26,711
Yo, Kevin was just telling me
he's looking for some watches.

223
00:14:26,711 --> 00:14:29,955
Are you looking for watches?
Let's go to a little wall of watches right there.

224
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:32,610
- What are we talking? AP?
- I was thinking about...

225
00:14:32,736 --> 00:14:34,304
I was thinking about Presi though.

226
00:14:34,769 --> 00:14:36,421
One you got that crazy ass deal for?

227
00:14:36,421 --> 00:14:40,348
I want for 16.
Crazy one though, no?

228
00:14:40,491 --> 00:14:42,970
Yeah, the... It's insane.

229
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:46,194
Look at this, there it is.

230
00:14:47,806 --> 00:14:50,622
That's a small watch
for a big man, I don't know.

231
00:14:52,988 --> 00:14:54,088
You got papers for this?

232
00:14:54,088 --> 00:14:57,145
- No, I don't have box and papers.
- Of course, I have fucking papers for that.

233
00:14:57,268 --> 00:14:59,146
I don’t have either one.
What are you talking about?

234
00:14:59,146 --> 00:15:01,981
- You sold me this shit, dummy.
- I don't remember that.

235
00:15:02,111 --> 00:15:03,947
Niggas calling niggas out for this, man.

236
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:07,102
- Of course, if you don't have a box and pap...
- You find me one nigga...

237
00:15:07,102 --> 00:15:09,314
One nigga with a KMH watch
they called out?

238
00:15:09,543 --> 00:15:10,859
- I will wait.
- It's a moot point.

239
00:15:10,859 --> 00:15:13,303
Demany, because 
I don't have these, all right?

240
00:15:13,389 --> 00:15:15,908
So how about we move onto
the diamonds here?

241
00:15:16,514 --> 00:15:19,690
You got a girl?
Why don't you get your girl a treat.

242
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:21,420
He doesn't have a girlfriend.

243
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,008
- Says who?
- Says you.

244
00:15:24,358 --> 00:15:26,143
How do you know
if I got a girlfriend or not?

245
00:15:26,143 --> 00:15:28,076
- What are you talking about?
- 'Cause you told me.

246
00:15:28,076 --> 00:15:29,735
- I never said that.
- Let's see what you got.

247
00:15:29,735 --> 00:15:30,898
- What the fuck are you doing?
- What? What's up?

248
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:32,610
Why didn’t you bring
a, goddamn, watches?

249
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:35,468
- I'm sorry, I'm not doing that.
- Nigga would've bought one!

250
00:15:35,592 --> 00:15:37,714
I told you, you can keep 
them in my safe.

251
00:15:37,714 --> 00:15:40,444
I don't want you selling them 
outta my showroom, you understand me?

252
00:15:40,551 --> 00:15:42,909
Fucking dumbass, where, the fuck, 
am I gonna sell them, nigga?

253
00:15:42,909 --> 00:15:45,082
- On the, goddamn, street?
- That's not my problem, man.

254
00:15:45,082 --> 00:15:46,333
- Oh, that ain't your fucking problem?
- No.

255
00:15:46,457 --> 00:15:47,347
It ain't your fucking...

256
00:15:47,456 --> 00:15:49,554
- He doesn't like shit in this dusty motherfucking...
- Yes, he does.

257
00:15:49,665 --> 00:15:52,332
He's having a, fucking, ball here.
What are you talking about?

258
00:15:52,332 --> 00:15:54,966
What the fuck is he gonna buy?
The goddamn Furby, nigga?

259
00:15:57,325 --> 00:15:58,602
Fuck you, all right?

260
00:15:58,602 --> 00:16:00,232
I'm gonna take his ass
to, motherfucking, Flawless.

261
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,906
- You're not taking him to Flawless.
- I'm taking him to Flawless.

262
00:16:04,612 --> 00:16:07,695
KG, do me a favor,
don't lean on that, please.

263
00:16:09,482 --> 00:16:11,420
Oh my God. Okay.

264
00:16:11,619 --> 00:16:13,420
Buzz him in!
Buzz him in now!

265
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:16,611
Oh my God!
Is this...?

266
00:16:16,611 --> 00:16:18,937
This is it!

267
00:16:18,937 --> 00:16:19,952
- Hey.
- What's up?

268
00:16:19,952 --> 00:16:21,712
- Okay, look at this.
- I got a package from Fishtonic.

269
00:16:21,712 --> 00:16:23,266
- Where you want this?
- Bring it in. Bring it in.

270
00:16:23,266 --> 00:16:26,567
Go to my office.
KG, don't you dare leave, okay?

271
00:16:26,567 --> 00:16:29,328
What's in this package
is gonna blow your mind, KG.

272
00:16:29,743 --> 00:16:31,594
- Is it heavy?
- Yes.

273
00:16:31,594 --> 00:16:33,439
Yes! Yes!

274
00:16:33,487 --> 00:16:34,793
Oh my God!

275
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:38,705
Fuck yeah!

276
00:16:39,488 --> 00:16:41,221
- For you.
- Give me that.

277
00:16:55,478 --> 00:16:57,301
Man, I can't do this anymore, bro!

278
00:16:57,337 --> 00:16:58,834
What happened?

279
00:16:59,023 --> 00:17:01,448
Your street goons in there,
they attacked me, man.

280
00:17:01,585 --> 00:17:03,331
What did you say
to piss them off?

281
00:17:03,331 --> 00:17:06,393
Listen, Garnett's crew came in here,
they took a look around.

282
00:17:06,393 --> 00:17:08,986
They see these guys, they like,
"Yo, who works here and who doesn't?".

283
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:11,242
Who doesn't - get out.
I said these guys don't work here.

284
00:17:11,242 --> 00:17:13,226
That was stupid,
you shouldn't have said that.

285
00:17:13,226 --> 00:17:15,004
These guys grabbed me,
they dragged me over the collar.

286
00:17:15,004 --> 00:17:15,996
They ripped my shirt.

287
00:17:16,121 --> 00:17:17,975
- Okay, look, here. Take this shirt.
- They made me look like a fool over here.

288
00:17:17,975 --> 00:17:20,859
It's a Gucci shirt, it's $500,
it's brand-new.

289
00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:22,517
Are you fucking serious right now?

290
00:17:22,517 --> 00:17:24,377
- The tag is still on.
- It ain't about the shirt.

291
00:17:24,392 --> 00:17:26,288
You know what I'm saying,
I gave you 8 years of my life.

292
00:17:26,288 --> 00:17:28,253
Look how you treat me, man.
I...

293
00:17:28,253 --> 00:17:31,548
I put everything into this business,
I saved your ass a thousand times.

294
00:17:32,214 --> 00:17:36,320
I can't take this place anymore, man.
I can't deal with your problems every other day.

295
00:17:36,689 --> 00:17:40,132
Listen, there are a lot of people on this block
that would love to do business with me.

296
00:17:40,132 --> 00:17:44,664
When you gonna see me out there, working with them,
you not gonna like it, man, you gonna be jealous.

297
00:17:45,846 --> 00:17:48,049
You not gonna like it, Howard.

298
00:17:49,433 --> 00:17:51,047
Howard? Hello?

299
00:17:52,598 --> 00:17:54,634
I'm standing here, man.

300
00:17:55,326 --> 00:17:58,041
There are a lot of people I could be 
doing business with other than you, Howard.

301
00:17:58,306 --> 00:18:00,648
You're falling apart,
you're looking like a fool out here

302
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:01,961
on the diamond district.

303
00:18:02,118 --> 00:18:03,771
Looking through, fucking, fish?

304
00:18:04,551 --> 00:18:08,779
Come on, man, I gave you 8 years of my life,
and you can't even fucking talk to me

305
00:18:08,779 --> 00:18:10,581
and look me in the eyes?

306
00:18:10,581 --> 00:18:12,094
Man to fucking man?

307
00:18:12,226 --> 00:18:14,892
Holy shit, I'm gonna cum.

308
00:18:15,267 --> 00:18:17,923
Fuck you, man.
I'm finished with this shithole.

309
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:28,776
KG! KG!

310
00:18:30,438 --> 00:18:33,057
- Howard, Yussi is gone, gone for good.
- That's fine with me.

311
00:18:33,057 --> 00:18:34,797
Let me get that phone.

312
00:18:34,797 --> 00:18:37,023
KG, you gotta come here, all right?

313
00:18:37,141 --> 00:18:38,959
- I gotta show you something.
- I gotta leave soon, man.

314
00:18:38,959 --> 00:18:40,914
- I know you have to leave, listen to me.
- I gotta get out of here.

315
00:18:40,915 --> 00:18:44,713
Okay, so I'm watching TV,
like a year ago, all right?

316
00:18:44,713 --> 00:18:48,324
I'm watching one of those, fucking, 
history channel shows, trying to learn shit.

317
00:18:48,324 --> 00:18:51,388
And I stumbled...
You ever hear about African Jews?

318
00:18:51,388 --> 00:18:54,434
- African Jews?
- Yeah, no, all right, no.

319
00:18:54,434 --> 00:18:57,357
- Nigga wants everyone to be a Jew.
- Checks this out. Checks this out.

320
00:18:57,357 --> 00:18:58,329
All right?

321
00:18:58,329 --> 00:19:03,212
So, these are black Jews, all right?
They're stranded in the middle of Ethiopia.

322
00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:04,909
- It's deep shit.
- Stranded?

323
00:19:04,909 --> 00:19:08,855
Yeah, look, they got nothing.
They don't got cars, they don't got shit.

324
00:19:08,855 --> 00:19:10,803
And I'm watching this,
and I'm like - what the fuck

325
00:19:10,803 --> 00:19:12,381
are these guys wearing? Look.

326
00:19:12,381 --> 00:19:14,725
It's on the tower over there,
it's everywhere, right?

327
00:19:14,927 --> 00:19:15,899
What the fuck?

328
00:19:15,899 --> 00:19:19,407
Where are these, fucking, guys
get precious black opals?

329
00:19:19,407 --> 00:19:21,204
- That's what that is.
- It's black opal?

330
00:19:21,257 --> 00:19:23,720
I do my research,
these guys live near the Weio mines,

331
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,913
which, primarily, red opals,
which aren't worth shit.

332
00:19:26,913 --> 00:19:27,831
- Okay?
- Oh, okay.

333
00:19:27,831 --> 00:19:31,678
But these, I can get your hands on 
these things, you understand?

334
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,758
- Really?
- So, look.

335
00:19:32,758 --> 00:19:35,418
I said to myself,
how do I get ahold of these guys?

336
00:19:35,418 --> 00:19:39,033
And I managed to track these guys down
and buy one from them.

337
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:41,287
- Holy shit, what is that?
- What is that?

338
00:19:41,287 --> 00:19:43,523
That's what it is.
That's the rock.

339
00:19:43,523 --> 00:19:46,846
That's the rock.
That's the stone I got from them.

340
00:19:47,278 --> 00:19:48,833
How the fuck
did you get this shit, man?

341
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:51,354
It took me, fucking, 17 months
to get this thing.

342
00:19:51,354 --> 00:19:52,876
- Holy shit.
- Just look at this.

343
00:19:52,876 --> 00:19:55,250
Hang on for a second.
Go through my loupe.

344
00:19:55,301 --> 00:19:57,539
- Be careful, that’s my best loupe.
- Let me see this, man.

345
00:19:57,577 --> 00:19:58,886
I want you to look...

346
00:19:58,886 --> 00:20:01,311
- You really into that motherfucker.
- Look at this.

347
00:20:02,612 --> 00:20:04,741
That's history, right there,
you understand?

348
00:20:04,741 --> 00:20:05,800
How many carats is this?

349
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:09,667
What, four, five thousand carats?
3000 dollars for a carat, I don't know.

350
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,141
- What?
- I'm not fucking bullshitting you.

351
00:20:11,224 --> 00:20:13,319
Why does it have so many 
colors in it, man, what is this?

352
00:20:13,401 --> 00:20:16,533
That's the thing, they say you can see
the whole universe in opal.

353
00:20:16,533 --> 00:20:18,272
 That's how fucking old they are.

354
00:20:18,272 --> 00:20:20,067
- Holy shit.
- I've been telling you.

355
00:20:20,233 --> 00:20:22,419
- That's why I wanted you to see it.
- I gotta have one.

356
00:20:22,419 --> 00:20:24,122
You know, it's crazy, man.

357
00:20:24,122 --> 00:20:27,893
That's, fucking, from stone to stone.
Garnet's a stone, you know that.

358
00:20:28,138 --> 00:20:30,552
That's a million dollar opal
you are holding.

359
00:20:30,552 --> 00:20:36,472
Straight from the Ethiopian Jewish tribe.
I mean this is old school, middle earth shit.

360
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,561
You got a, motherfuckin', dinosaur gem.

361
00:20:39,955 --> 00:20:43,288
That’s right. The dinosaurs were
fuckin' staring at this thing.

362
00:20:43,459 --> 00:20:48,246
It's 110 million years old, at least.
It's deep shit.

363
00:20:52,989 --> 00:20:54,190
KG, are you okay?

364
00:20:54,443 --> 00:20:56,302
- Are you all right?
- You gonna be all right?

365
00:20:56,454 --> 00:20:57,923
Told you not to lean.

366
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,823
Give him a fucking towel or something.

367
00:21:00,042 --> 00:21:02,042
You heard me, I said 
"tell them not to lean".

368
00:21:02,468 --> 00:21:03,822
Are you all right?

369
00:21:03,896 --> 00:21:05,566
That's a sign though.
That's a sign.

370
00:21:05,821 --> 00:21:08,410
That's a sign for that. I need this.
That what it is.

371
00:21:09,316 --> 00:21:11,004
Gotta make sure 
my nigga good, bro.

372
00:21:11,004 --> 00:21:13,812
Fucking glass, I'm telling you.
It's a lot of weight you put on.

373
00:21:13,812 --> 00:21:16,253
That's the sign. I need this.
I need this gem.

374
00:21:16,253 --> 00:21:19,541
Listen, that's not for sale, I can't.
I can't sell it to you.

375
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:21,935
- What do you mean it's not for sale?
- I can't do it.

376
00:21:22,818 --> 00:21:26,317
Goddamn, it's set per auction.
I can't...

377
00:21:26,317 --> 00:21:29,148
Why the fuck would you show me something,
if I couldn't have it then?

378
00:21:29,323 --> 00:21:31,172
Why the fuck would you 
bring this out, you know?

379
00:21:31,172 --> 00:21:33,254
Sorry, I was excited.
Excited to share with you.

380
00:21:33,254 --> 00:21:36,512
Let me hold it for the night then.
Let me wear it to the game tonight, right?

381
00:21:36,734 --> 00:21:38,765
Would be cool, I'm going to the game,
nigga, I'll grab it from you,

382
00:21:38,765 --> 00:21:40,850
then meet you at Adley's
tomorrow morning, first thing.

383
00:21:41,256 --> 00:21:42,780
Cool, just like that.

384
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,492
- Howard, come on.
- It's one night, Howard.

385
00:21:45,492 --> 00:21:46,800
- I can't.
- It's one night.

386
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,813
- He's good for it.
- They'll pull it from the auction.

387
00:21:48,843 --> 00:21:52,574
You don't understand.
This stone, I'm really connecting with this.

388
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:55,952
I feel like I’m gonna have
40 or 50 on this, man.

389
00:21:57,701 --> 00:21:59,455
You understand that?

390
00:21:59,455 --> 00:22:02,414
You see what I'm fucking talking about, Howard?
That shit is speaking to him, you know.

391
00:22:02,414 --> 00:22:04,309
I'm gonna destroy
Philly tonight with this.

392
00:22:04,309 --> 00:22:05,461
It's a spiritual man.

393
00:22:05,461 --> 00:22:08,925
Bitch ass nigga, this, fucking, thing 
makes me feel like I can fly.

394
00:22:10,431 --> 00:22:13,845
So, you are going to
@MeAndHowie tag?

395
00:22:13,973 --> 00:22:16,404
- Yes. Yes, I got you.
- 30 fucking pics, I want likes.

396
00:22:17,113 --> 00:22:20,319
- Let me get a fucking shot.
- That's a good idea, man.

397
00:22:20,491 --> 00:22:24,485
Come here, so you're holding up?
Look at this shit.

398
00:22:24,624 --> 00:22:26,059
- Boom.
- Boom.

399
00:22:27,707 --> 00:22:30,126
I can't just...
Give me something as collateral.

400
00:22:30,126 --> 00:22:31,751
- I want the ring.
- Howard, calm the fuck down.

401
00:22:31,751 --> 00:22:34,126
- As collateral, I need to make sure he's bringing it back.
- No, no, he's good money, man.

402
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,945
- I know he is, I want to make sure...
- That's a deal. That's a deal.

403
00:22:37,368 --> 00:22:38,821
- I'll give you that.
- Thanks.

404
00:22:38,971 --> 00:22:42,342
And I'm gonna keep it right here,
right next to my Knicks '73.

405
00:22:42,476 --> 00:22:44,027
- Classic.
- Classic, I like that.

406
00:22:44,038 --> 00:22:46,248
- I appreciate it.
- I got you.

407
00:22:47,052 --> 00:22:50,687
- Listen, you meet me!
- I'll meet your happy ass, yes.

408
00:22:50,687 --> 00:22:54,045
You will, fucking, bring that stone
to me, 9 in the morning.

409
00:22:54,045 --> 00:22:56,147
Hey, hey, listen to me.
No dicking around.

410
00:22:56,147 --> 00:22:57,485
You show up, you hear me?

411
00:22:57,485 --> 00:22:58,640
Chill.

412
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,490
I'll see you there, motherfucker.
All right, let's roll out.

413
00:23:03,376 --> 00:23:04,703
Buzz ‘em out.

414
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:06,118
I got his earrings.

415
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:08,525
The earrings.
Wait, bring them out to him.

416
00:23:08,577 --> 00:23:10,595
Keep them, keep them to the mall,
I'll grab them.

417
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:13,174
Black Jew empower, nigga!

418
00:23:17,243 --> 00:23:21,722
What the fuck...
Who's gonna clean this, fucking, shit?

419
00:23:22,446 --> 00:23:24,024
Eddie boy! What are you doing?

420
00:23:24,916 --> 00:23:25,991
What do you want, Dad?

421
00:23:25,991 --> 00:23:28,766
Look what I got,
look, you gonna love this.

422
00:23:28,997 --> 00:23:32,623
Here, what's that right there?
Would you leave me alone?

423
00:23:32,715 --> 00:23:34,887
- What is this?
- It's Kevin Garnett’s ring.

424
00:23:34,887 --> 00:23:38,417
Championship ring.
NBA, 2008, I knew you'd freak out.

425
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:39,398
Sick!

426
00:23:39,398 --> 00:23:41,781
All right, I love you, my boy.

427
00:23:45,939 --> 00:23:48,728
Roberto, came to work.

428
00:23:51,245 --> 00:23:53,239
- Bronstein.
- Hey, Howard.

429
00:23:53,239 --> 00:23:56,109
Hey, break out your tray.
Where is it? Where is it?

430
00:23:56,275 --> 00:23:58,548
I'd shake your hand,
but I know where it's been.

431
00:23:58,548 --> 00:24:02,853
Look at this, that’s Kevin Garnett’s
2008 championship ring.

432
00:24:02,853 --> 00:24:05,818
- Championship ring?
- Championship ring, 2008.

433
00:24:05,818 --> 00:24:07,544
All right, you wanna pawn it
or you wanna sell it?

434
00:24:07,544 --> 00:24:08,931
I wanna pawn it.

435
00:24:08,931 --> 00:24:10,822
- Let me take a quick look at it.
- Right, okay.

436
00:24:10,822 --> 00:24:12,001
I don't know
what you are looking for.

437
00:24:12,001 --> 00:24:14,026
- Check the diamond.
- That was just on his fucking finger.

438
00:24:14,026 --> 00:24:17,019
It's single cut, you know, Howie.
It's single cut, it's not even a full cut.

439
00:24:17,019 --> 00:24:19,572
Okay, you talk to the fucking League 
about the way the cut this shit.

440
00:24:19,743 --> 00:24:22,350
- They worth less.
- Take a look at this, all right?

441
00:24:22,545 --> 00:24:23,939
All right, it's his ring, I understand.

442
00:24:23,939 --> 00:24:26,099
It's from his Instagram, 
it's, fucking, blowing up right now?

443
00:24:26,099 --> 00:24:28,065
I hear you, all right.
So, what do you need for it?

444
00:24:28,065 --> 00:24:31,194
I figured, that thing's worth 80 grand?

445
00:24:31,501 --> 00:24:34,863
Just loan it to me, that's it.
Just loan it to me, I'll be back Friday.

446
00:24:34,863 --> 00:24:36,673
Number one - we both know what's in here.

447
00:24:36,673 --> 00:24:39,442
We both know that the value 
is mostly cause of memorabilia.

448
00:24:39,525 --> 00:24:41,173
- But it is a memorabilia piece.
- Yes.

449
00:24:41,173 --> 00:24:44,192
- So that’s why you’d be able to sell it.
- So I'll tell you what.

450
00:24:44,844 --> 00:24:46,840
Give me 50 Gs.
Just float it for me.

451
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:50,524
I'm gonna give you 25 thousand dollars,
but I want an 8 % vig on the ring.

452
00:24:50,524 --> 00:24:54,416
8 %? Fucking, how about I give you a grand, 
you take a grand off the top.

453
00:24:54,416 --> 00:24:55,932
I'm gonna come back Friday for it.

454
00:24:55,932 --> 00:24:57,751
You know last time you left
something here for 6 months.

455
00:24:57,751 --> 00:24:58,897
So we wanna make sure upfront.

456
00:24:58,897 --> 00:25:01,694
Last time wasn’t my fault, 
we fucking went over that.

457
00:25:01,694 --> 00:25:03,452
I understand, let's make it quick.

458
00:25:03,452 --> 00:25:06,981
21 thousand dollars, 7 % vig.
And I want you to know.

459
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:09,787
Say, you'll be back Friday,
if you're not back Friday, it's my ring.

460
00:25:09,787 --> 00:25:12,116
If I don't bring it back Friday, 
I'm a dead man, so...

461
00:25:12,116 --> 00:25:14,638
- All right, so we have a deal?
- All right, deal.

462
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:16,523
- Mazel.
- Mazel.

463
00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:20,813
- Can you go to the stake and get me the money?
- Get him the money, we'll get you the money.

464
00:25:20,813 --> 00:25:24,674
Hey, good Pesach.
This is great.

465
00:25:26,667 --> 00:25:30,300
70th and 1st? 
The fuck is he doing there?

466
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,683
Just walking.

467
00:25:32,598 --> 00:25:34,822
Now he's stopping, he's slowing down.

468
00:25:37,914 --> 00:25:39,192
Why?

469
00:25:39,192 --> 00:25:41,803
He's doing something. 
He's playing with his phone or something.

470
00:25:41,803 --> 00:25:44,061
He's playing with something. 
I can't make it out.

471
00:25:44,061 --> 00:25:46,988
- I can't see him, his back is to me.
- He’s hunched over. You can’t see.

472
00:25:46,988 --> 00:25:49,477
I don't know. We can't see anything.

473
00:25:49,851 --> 00:25:52,225
Here we go, see.
Here we go, he's going again.

474
00:25:52,225 --> 00:25:55,322
- Wait, I just got a text from him.
- What's he saying?

475
00:25:55,496 --> 00:25:57,987
- It's a picture of money.
- This fucking prick.

476
00:25:57,987 --> 00:25:59,768
- It says, "Arno...
- He's got fucking money.

477
00:25:59,768 --> 00:26:01,905
I got your money right here".

478
00:26:01,905 --> 00:26:04,665
- He’s turning into somewhere.
- A restaurant, Nino’s.

479
00:26:05,444 --> 00:26:07,219
Hey, handsome, where is he at?

480
00:26:07,219 --> 00:26:08,996
He's in the back.

481
00:26:14,929 --> 00:26:17,377
Hey, you gonna make me palls in the back?

482
00:26:18,507 --> 00:26:22,527
- Gary, Gary.
- ... you have your eggs no carrots in the Citazel.

483
00:26:22,527 --> 00:26:23,939
- Listen to me.
- What do you want?

484
00:26:23,939 --> 00:26:26,194
- I already made your bet.
- I know, I gotta change it.

485
00:26:26,194 --> 00:26:29,478
I got 21 thousand dollars.
You add it onto the nineteen.

486
00:26:29,478 --> 00:26:30,874
40 thousand dollars.

487
00:26:30,874 --> 00:26:32,253
- Scrap the whole bet?
- Scrap the whole.

488
00:26:32,253 --> 00:26:36,115
I wanna make a six-way parlay.
Celtics Sixers game, what's the line-up?

489
00:26:36,115 --> 00:26:37,308
- Still plus one.
- Plus one, okay.

490
00:26:37,308 --> 00:26:40,224
So, I want the Celtics to cover.
I want the Celtics halftime.

491
00:26:40,224 --> 00:26:43,788
I want Garnett's points and rebounds.
Garnett's block shots.

492
00:26:43,812 --> 00:26:46,565
Celtics opening tip, 
you take lightening bets?

493
00:26:46,565 --> 00:26:48,691
Yeah, but you don't want 
any part in lightening bets, come on.

494
00:26:48,691 --> 00:26:50,882
A thousand dollars a point, okay?
Take this.

495
00:26:50,882 --> 00:26:53,060
- And this is the gift from me.
- What's this?

496
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:55,377
Just for tolerating me 
for all this time, okay?

497
00:26:55,768 --> 00:26:58,116
No, I already have a Rolex, 
I don't need your watch.

498
00:26:58,237 --> 00:27:00,700
It probably fell off a truck anyway. 
But listen, what do you know?

499
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,571
Garnett this, Garnett that, 
what do you know?

500
00:27:02,571 --> 00:27:04,541
- I don't know, I just know.
- I'll tell you what I know.

501
00:27:04,541 --> 00:27:07,177
It's the dumbest, fucking, bet 
I've ever heard of.

502
00:27:07,468 --> 00:27:09,194
I disagree.

503
00:27:09,893 --> 00:27:11,813
I disagree, Gary.

504
00:27:12,379 --> 00:27:14,315
Let him shoot.

505
00:27:17,401 --> 00:27:18,678
Fuck!

506
00:27:20,679 --> 00:27:23,880
Fucking, those 5, fucking, steps into the...

507
00:27:25,656 --> 00:27:29,110
Jesus Christ! That's it.

508
00:27:29,782 --> 00:27:32,137
Tap to the KG.
That’s it. That’s it.

509
00:27:35,246 --> 00:27:37,246
Back him down.

510
00:27:37,909 --> 00:27:40,230
Fuck you! Yes!
That's it!

511
00:27:40,534 --> 00:27:43,149
That's it. That's my man!

512
00:27:44,401 --> 00:27:47,664
Let's go, get up on him.
Get up on him.

513
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:51,359
Fucking, get the fuck up on him, 
goddamn it!

514
00:27:51,694 --> 00:27:54,706
Howard, what are you doing?
What are you doing? Howard?

515
00:27:54,706 --> 00:27:57,537
- Beni is waiting for you
- Okay, I'm coming up.

516
00:27:57,565 --> 00:27:59,998
It's 25 minutes past his bedtime. Go.

517
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:01,529
Did he brush his teeth yet?

518
00:28:01,529 --> 00:28:04,406
Brush his teeth?! 
I sent you 7 texts in the dark.

519
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:08,314
Howard, it's the first quarter.

520
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:14,114
That guy was in my shop earlier today.
Look at him. Soft touch.

521
00:28:14,114 --> 00:28:15,970
He can fucking shoot...
- I don't care, Howard.

522
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:18,028
Howard, go say goodnight to your son.

523
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:20,837
Okay, I'll be right there.

524
00:28:22,274 --> 00:28:23,893
I'll be right there.

525
00:28:24,782 --> 00:28:26,737
Let me just get to the time-out.

526
00:28:26,737 --> 00:28:28,856
This, fucking, wrath is ridiculous.

527
00:28:28,856 --> 00:28:31,594
- Now!
- All right, I'm sorry.

528
00:28:38,506 --> 00:28:41,998
Rondo with 9 on the shot clock, 
only now to 3 minutes to go.

529
00:28:43,008 --> 00:28:49,513
Garnett put it up with 4 on the shoot. 
Garnett, vintage game one, for sure.

530
00:28:49,513 --> 00:28:52,311
15 points on 7 for 8 from the field.

531
00:28:52,532 --> 00:28:54,441
Oh, no!

532
00:28:56,455 --> 00:28:58,562
Oh, give me a fucking break.

533
00:28:58,562 --> 00:29:01,512
Fuck you Callahan! You cocksucker.

534
00:29:11,603 --> 00:29:14,283
- Hey, hey, right?
- Garnett's killing it right now.

535
00:29:14,492 --> 00:29:16,375
I know, Beni's sleeping.
Keep it down.

536
00:29:16,375 --> 00:29:17,667
I'm sorry. I'm so hyped.

537
00:29:17,667 --> 00:29:21,591
NBA is always the last 2, 
fucking, minutes, so let's calm down.

538
00:29:21,947 --> 00:29:23,261
Hit that KG!

539
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:24,438
- Dad, I bet money.
- Boom!

540
00:29:24,438 --> 00:29:26,277
Jason bet me 25 bucks 
for the first half.

541
00:29:26,277 --> 00:29:28,399
Doubled that up the last half, 
for another fifty bucks!

542
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:30,636
Your father bet a lot 
of money on this, son.

543
00:29:30,636 --> 00:29:32,748
Really? How much?

544
00:29:32,892 --> 00:29:35,043
- You don't wanna know.
- A lot though, right?

545
00:29:36,656 --> 00:29:40,308
Put that shit in the fucking hole!
That's right, come on, you can dunk again!

546
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,756
Amazing, this is amazing.

547
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:50,867
He’s down.
He's asleep.

548
00:30:05,778 --> 00:30:08,776
You flip it to ESPN, 
just for one second.

549
00:30:10,133 --> 00:30:13,401
This is a huge game,
That's why he's going so crazy up there.

550
00:30:13,401 --> 00:30:17,601
I’m tempted to wrangle the kids downstairs 
right now and get it over with.

551
00:30:18,176 --> 00:30:22,383
You really wanna do that?
I don't know how sensitive that is.

552
00:30:22,383 --> 00:30:23,935
You're calling me insensitive?

553
00:30:23,935 --> 00:30:27,248
I thought we both agreed 
that we wait till after Passover.

554
00:30:27,248 --> 00:30:29,642
Next you’ll be saying you wanna 
wait until after the summer.

555
00:30:29,969 --> 00:30:32,556
I’m not opposed to waiting 
till after summer.

556
00:30:33,383 --> 00:30:37,352
It's commercial, can't you just put the game on 
for two, fucking, minutes?

557
00:30:37,596 --> 00:30:39,751
Till my car gets here?

558
00:30:44,431 --> 00:30:48,756
Let's not chop the body.
No words to describe that.

559
00:30:51,678 --> 00:30:55,787
41? I don't know how old these guys are, 
but you can't tell by their age.

560
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:03,982
This is crazy.

561
00:31:03,982 --> 00:31:07,252
Here is KG hitting the shot from outside. 
He’ll be 36 on Saturday.

562
00:31:07,252 --> 00:31:11,976
And he puts the Celtics 
over the century mark, 101 to 76!

563
00:31:13,501 --> 00:31:16,956
Oh, yes!

564
00:31:17,491 --> 00:31:19,381
Oh, God. Yes!

565
00:31:19,381 --> 00:31:20,544
Oh, fuck!

566
00:31:20,544 --> 00:31:26,171
Oh my God!

567
00:31:28,738 --> 00:31:30,924
- Hey, change of plans.
- What's up?

568
00:31:32,372 --> 00:31:36,097
Take the exit, 49th street and 3rd avenue, 
Smith and Wollensky.

569
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:39,655
- Everything okay?
- I just... What's your name?

570
00:31:39,905 --> 00:31:41,358
Devis.

571
00:31:41,358 --> 00:31:45,657
I just hit very big, very big.
Oh my God!

572
00:31:52,501 --> 00:31:54,501
KG havin’ fun...

573
00:31:59,198 --> 00:32:00,884
Jules?

574
00:32:07,702 --> 00:32:09,224
Hey?

575
00:32:31,614 --> 00:32:34,657
- Hey, what's up?
- Baby, where are you at?

576
00:32:35,241 --> 00:32:38,164
I’m just going back right now, 
in the elevator. Why, what's up?

577
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:40,921
I got held up, 
I'm just on my way back now.

578
00:32:40,921 --> 00:32:43,439
Dinah was on the tear tonight.

579
00:32:44,002 --> 00:32:46,505
That sucks, how far away are you?

580
00:32:47,843 --> 00:32:50,998
I'm in the tunnel, 
just getting in there.

581
00:32:51,531 --> 00:32:54,292
- Okay, so you're very close.
- Yes.

582
00:32:54,448 --> 00:32:55,755
Hold on, I gotta go.
I gotta go.

583
00:32:55,755 --> 00:32:57,166
Wait, wait.

584
00:32:57,166 --> 00:32:58,718
- Hey.
- What?

585
00:32:58,718 --> 00:33:01,679
I can't wait to see you.
I'm in an incredible mood.

586
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:03,267
Okay, I got another line,
I got another line.

587
00:33:03,267 --> 00:33:05,193
- Gotta go, bye.
- Okay.

588
00:33:25,761 --> 00:33:28,307
As we speak, yeah, and I still 
have to set up the stakes.

589
00:33:28,307 --> 00:33:29,911
I still have to get ready.

590
00:33:29,911 --> 00:33:34,225
Because his gem came, do you not listen to me?
I've been talking about it all day.

591
00:33:35,904 --> 00:33:38,713
I'm gonna...
Remember the green? The photo I have?

592
00:33:40,082 --> 00:33:41,694
Yeah, I know, I know...

593
00:35:29,485 --> 00:35:31,621
I'm gonna cum!

594
00:35:31,621 --> 00:35:33,133
I can't help it.
I can't...

595
00:35:33,133 --> 00:35:34,768
Oh my God!

596
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:36,919
Why the fuck did you do that?

597
00:35:36,919 --> 00:35:40,668
You see how fucking sweet you look,
you look so gorgeous.

598
00:35:40,668 --> 00:35:43,113
I just hit so, fucking, big.

599
00:35:43,113 --> 00:35:45,402
- I hit so big.
- How big?

600
00:35:46,498 --> 00:35:48,726
Feel how wet I am.

601
00:36:03,948 --> 00:36:05,708
I'm almost there.

602
00:36:05,878 --> 00:36:07,895
What?
You told me that already.

603
00:36:07,895 --> 00:36:09,484
Yeah, I hit the mad traffic.

604
00:36:09,484 --> 00:36:12,341
What are you talking...
9 o'clock we were supposed to be there.

605
00:36:12,383 --> 00:36:14,890
- It's fucking 9:43
- Look, the whole city is clogged up.

606
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:16,083
I can't do anything about it.

607
00:36:16,083 --> 00:36:19,760
Not everybody's on 
"Demany-time", man, let's move!

608
00:36:25,452 --> 00:36:28,305
Okay, you can tell Anne we're here.

609
00:36:28,398 --> 00:36:30,360
I'm sorry, hold on one second.
Hi.

610
00:36:30,914 --> 00:36:33,238
Anne Debaugh,
Howard Ratner and his partner.

611
00:36:33,402 --> 00:36:34,812
We're all ready to go.

612
00:36:34,812 --> 00:36:38,150
Okay, when your partner gets here
I will let her know that you're here.

613
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:40,314
- Thanks.
- You can sit over there if you'd like.

614
00:36:41,669 --> 00:36:42,643
Yes?

615
00:36:42,643 --> 00:36:44,718
Hello, Howard, 
I'm pulling up right now, come out.

616
00:36:45,044 --> 00:36:47,552
- I said I'm inside.
- I'm not going find a parking here.

617
00:36:47,552 --> 00:36:49,831
- Double-park the car.
- No, I'm not getting no fucking ticket...

618
00:36:49,831 --> 00:36:51,658
- Do it.
- For you or nobody else.

619
00:36:51,658 --> 00:36:53,649
- What the...?
- Meet me, we'll talk to you.

620
00:36:54,052 --> 00:36:55,254
Are you fucking kidding me?

621
00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:57,732
No, I'm not fucking kidding you, 
I'm pulling up, come on.

622
00:37:00,096 --> 00:37:01,993
- Will be right back.
- Okay.

623
00:37:03,032 --> 00:37:05,330
Fuck!

624
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,104
Howard, Howard!

625
00:37:13,104 --> 00:37:15,372
Jesus, how did you find me?

626
00:37:15,372 --> 00:37:17,159
- Your office told me where you are.
- You're following me?

627
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:19,056
- Yeah, we need the money today.
- My office would never tell you that.

628
00:37:19,056 --> 00:37:20,702
- This is the last straw.
- Get out of here.

629
00:37:20,702 --> 00:37:23,985
You haven’t been returning my phone calls or texts. 
You can’t take ten minutes to...

630
00:37:23,985 --> 00:37:25,731
What, you're bringing 
your, fucking, heavy with you?

631
00:37:25,731 --> 00:37:27,732
- Yeah. You got my money?
- You want money?

632
00:37:27,732 --> 00:37:29,470
- Yeah, you owe me 32 grand.
- I've got no, fucking, money.

633
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:32,035
Fine, fine.
Look, that's 30 grand.

634
00:37:32,035 --> 00:37:33,960
Fucking sell that for 15 Gs.

635
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,491
15 Gs, where?
Where I'm gonna sell this?

636
00:37:35,491 --> 00:37:39,662
Go to Wempe’s, 55th and 5th avenue. 
Go there, put that in your, fucking, pocket.

637
00:37:39,662 --> 00:37:41,296
Hey, hey.
Where is it at?

638
00:37:41,641 --> 00:37:43,255
Where's the gem?

639
00:37:43,255 --> 00:37:44,514
You give me the gem. 
I'll run it up to Siz.

640
00:37:44,837 --> 00:37:46,783
- Get in, I need to talk to you.
- I don't know anything about the watch.

641
00:37:46,783 --> 00:37:48,610
Hey, get the fuck out of here.
I don't want a watch.

642
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:50,369
You just gave it to me, 
for the money you owe me.

643
00:37:50,369 --> 00:37:51,501
- Shut the fuck up, 
- This is half the money.

644
00:37:51,501 --> 00:37:53,445
I'm not, fucking, buying 
watches right now.

645
00:37:53,445 --> 00:37:54,674
- Back the fuck up.
- Take shit.

646
00:37:54,674 --> 00:37:58,251
- Don't touch my shit.
- Walk the fuck away, man.

647
00:37:58,251 --> 00:37:59,040
Come on, give me the opal.

648
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,107
- Get in, nigga, just want to talk to you.
- They are waiting on us!

649
00:38:01,107 --> 00:38:04,444
- Get in, we'll talk, man.
- What do I getting in, fucking, car for?

650
00:38:04,498 --> 00:38:05,654
Jesus Christ!

651
00:38:05,654 --> 00:38:08,789
Get out of here 
with that, fucking, Fugazi shit!

652
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:14,355
Why am I in your car right now?
They are, fucking, waiting on us.

653
00:38:14,355 --> 00:38:15,156
Where is the opal?

654
00:38:15,156 --> 00:38:18,566
We’re at the, fucking, hotel, getting ready to go, 
about to go party, we got 3 bad bitches.

655
00:38:18,566 --> 00:38:20,326
I don't have time for this. 
Where is my opal?

656
00:38:20,326 --> 00:38:22,455
And KG leaves his, 
fucking, ID upstairs, so...

657
00:38:22,455 --> 00:38:25,311
Demany, we don't have time!
They are waiting for us!

658
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:27,634
- Where is the fucking opal?
- Garnett’s got it.

659
00:38:27,927 --> 00:38:30,538
Garnett’s got it?
That guy fucked us.

660
00:38:30,538 --> 00:38:32,125
I don't know what the fuck 
you want me to do about that.

661
00:38:32,125 --> 00:38:34,255
Call him up. Call him on the phone.
Let me talk to him.

662
00:38:34,255 --> 00:38:36,391
I can't, fucking, call him 
right now, he's at practice.

663
00:38:36,391 --> 00:38:38,707
- Tell him I'll give him another opal for free.
- Howard, listen to me.

664
00:38:38,707 --> 00:38:41,702
- I can't call him because he is at practice.
- To wear for as long as he wants.

665
00:38:41,702 --> 00:38:44,463
My nigga, he's not gonna answer 
his, fucking, phone for me, God, or anybody else.

666
00:38:44,463 --> 00:38:46,391
Fine, then we'll go on the practice.

667
00:38:46,391 --> 00:38:47,306
What?

668
00:38:47,306 --> 00:38:49,216
So, you want me to go 
to, fucking, Philly right now?

669
00:38:49,216 --> 00:38:51,358
He's in Philly?
Then, we're going to Philly.

670
00:38:51,358 --> 00:38:53,139
I just got back from Philly, man.
I'm not driving...

671
00:38:53,139 --> 00:38:56,053
It's 2 fucking hours to get there.
Come on, come on.

672
00:38:59,592 --> 00:39:02,487
Fuck this!
Let's drive!

673
00:39:04,363 --> 00:39:06,158
We gotta be in and out. 
In and out.

674
00:39:06,158 --> 00:39:07,912
I got my daughter's play tonight.

675
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:11,214
How's that? Is that KG?
Tell him we're here, we're coming in.

676
00:39:11,222 --> 00:39:13,339
You gotta calm,
your happy ass, down.

677
00:39:13,479 --> 00:39:16,151
Are we going inside the facility,
or we gonna meet him out here?

678
00:39:16,151 --> 00:39:17,445
Just chill the fuck out!

679
00:39:17,445 --> 00:39:18,600
I hope we'll see Rondo in there.

680
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:21,001
I'd love to tell him thank you 
for trapping all those dimes.

681
00:39:21,001 --> 00:39:22,595
Man, no, that's not...
They're busy.

682
00:39:22,595 --> 00:39:25,890
And what the fuck is this with you 
Jewish niggas and basketball anyway?

683
00:39:26,643 --> 00:39:30,937
I’ll have you know the first two points 
scored in the NBA was a Jew.

684
00:39:30,937 --> 00:39:33,597
- Yeah, What? Fred Flinstein?
- No?

685
00:39:33,597 --> 00:39:37,329
Ozzie Sheckman. 1946. 
Played for the Knicks.

686
00:39:37,329 --> 00:39:40,566
Here we go!
This is where the big boys play.

687
00:39:42,062 --> 00:39:44,794
They always got to practice.

688
00:39:44,794 --> 00:39:46,301
Look at this!
This is sick.

689
00:39:46,301 --> 00:39:47,882
Sick, my God!

690
00:39:47,882 --> 00:39:50,160
Hey, check this out.

691
00:39:57,699 --> 00:39:59,925
And he scores.

692
00:40:00,805 --> 00:40:02,734
- Hey, I need to get through.
- Sorry.

693
00:40:05,777 --> 00:40:07,101
Demany!

694
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,631
What's up?
I'm with him.

695
00:40:12,194 --> 00:40:13,607
No, no. I'm with him.
Demany.

696
00:40:13,979 --> 00:40:15,024
What the fuck?

697
00:40:15,277 --> 00:40:16,223
Excuse me.

698
00:40:16,223 --> 00:40:17,423
What's he fucking...

699
00:40:17,881 --> 00:40:19,535
I'm with him,
I came with him.

700
00:40:19,755 --> 00:40:20,878
You saw me 
walked through the door.

701
00:40:20,878 --> 00:40:22,065
No, I didn't see 
you walk through the door.

702
00:40:22,065 --> 00:40:24,660
- What's your name?
- I won't be on the list, 'cause I came with him.

703
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:26,390
I came with him.

704
00:40:26,487 --> 00:40:28,272
What, the fuck, is he doing to me?

705
00:40:28,272 --> 00:40:30,272
Cocksucking fucker works for me!

706
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,047
Is Marcel excited?

707
00:40:32,954 --> 00:40:34,812
Yeah, I think she's a little nervous.

708
00:40:39,235 --> 00:40:42,805
- And Danny's got a role too.
- Small part, he's nervous, but.

709
00:40:42,805 --> 00:40:45,060
- Good.
- Nothing phases him.

710
00:40:45,214 --> 00:40:46,947
He said she was amazing.

711
00:40:48,637 --> 00:40:50,519
What are you guys doing 
for the break?

712
00:40:52,249 --> 00:40:54,404
We're not doing anything this year.

713
00:40:54,685 --> 00:40:56,470
- Oh, really?
- Wow.

714
00:40:56,569 --> 00:40:58,013
That's not like you, guys.

715
00:40:58,013 --> 00:40:59,867
How come? 
Howard, how come?

716
00:40:59,867 --> 00:41:01,530
- Howard? 
- Everything okay?

717
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:02,981
Howard?

718
00:41:04,638 --> 00:41:05,785
No vacation?

719
00:41:05,785 --> 00:41:09,424
No, next year we're gonna 
take a big trip,

720
00:41:09,424 --> 00:41:11,466
saving up for that, 
gonna go to Europe.

721
00:41:11,466 --> 00:41:13,950
- That's nice.
- So, yeah...

722
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:17,102
Do a little culture.
These kids are becoming morons.

723
00:41:18,156 --> 00:41:20,838
- Oh, yeah.
- We'll be morons in Concun.

724
00:41:21,114 --> 00:41:23,200
Right, especially on the trapeze.

725
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:25,832
Good luck to Danny tonight.
When is he coming?

726
00:41:25,851 --> 00:41:27,754
We just talked about Danny.

727
00:41:28,734 --> 00:41:31,419
What are you gonna do for Passover?
Is your sister coming?

728
00:41:31,419 --> 00:41:32,244
Yeah.

729
00:41:32,244 --> 00:41:33,526
What are you doing?
What do you got?

730
00:41:33,526 --> 00:41:36,975
Watching through a phone.
I got six different players, in six different games.

731
00:41:37,528 --> 00:41:39,102
We’re all making sacrifices.

732
00:41:39,102 --> 00:41:41,471
Hey, who tapped me.
Who was that?

733
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:54,064
But that'll be nice.
You gonna do the questions?

734
00:41:54,722 --> 00:41:56,256
Yeah, you were practicing?

735
00:41:56,266 --> 00:41:57,996
I've been practicing.

736
00:41:57,996 --> 00:42:00,159
I don't know how are we 
gonna fit it in Mexico.

737
00:42:03,798 --> 00:42:05,664
Good luck to Marcel.

738
00:42:05,664 --> 00:42:07,739
I know, and to Danny.

739
00:42:08,465 --> 00:42:09,437
Where are you going?

740
00:42:09,437 --> 00:42:11,419
Daddy's gonna go to bathroom.
I'll be right back.

741
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:13,616
I'll be back, thank you.

742
00:42:13,756 --> 00:42:15,965
Howard, Marcel is about 
to get on the stage.

743
00:42:15,981 --> 00:42:18,656
- Okay. I'll be right back.
- Howard, are you okay?

744
00:42:24,011 --> 00:42:25,456
This is fucked up guys?

745
00:42:25,456 --> 00:42:27,008
What is so fucked up about it?

746
00:42:28,959 --> 00:42:31,913
- May I speak to you, guys, outside?
- You sure you wanna do that?

747
00:42:31,913 --> 00:42:33,484
Yeah? All right.

748
00:42:33,913 --> 00:42:35,061
Excuse me.

749
00:42:39,862 --> 00:42:43,384
Howard, hey.
What are we gonna do here, man?

750
00:42:44,285 --> 00:42:45,270
Come on, man.

751
00:42:45,402 --> 00:42:47,579
That's my family!

752
00:42:47,826 --> 00:42:49,090
Get the fuck off me!

753
00:42:51,749 --> 00:42:52,947
I got you!

754
00:42:56,927 --> 00:42:59,595
Hey, I'm a cop.
That looks great.

755
00:43:04,932 --> 00:43:06,790
Are you kidding me? 
How good you guys look.

756
00:43:06,790 --> 00:43:08,271
Dad, what are you doing?

757
00:43:08,271 --> 00:43:10,838
Marcel, break a leg, 
we’re all here for you!

758
00:43:25,059 --> 00:43:26,226
Fuck!

759
00:43:41,867 --> 00:43:43,741
- Get him, get him!
- Fuck!

760
00:43:45,392 --> 00:43:46,605
Fucking shit!

761
00:43:48,478 --> 00:43:49,587
Come here, you motherfucker!

762
00:43:49,587 --> 00:43:51,908
Hey, fuck you, fuck you!

763
00:43:56,421 --> 00:43:58,219
Come on, get up!

764
00:44:00,237 --> 00:44:01,738
Come on.

765
00:44:02,191 --> 00:44:03,885
I'm coming.

766
00:44:04,469 --> 00:44:06,326
What the fuck!
You, fucking, bit me?!

767
00:44:08,249 --> 00:44:09,635
Arno!

768
00:44:10,428 --> 00:44:12,803
- Get him the in the car!
- Arno!

769
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:15,010
What the fuck?

770
00:44:15,623 --> 00:44:17,856
Go, go, go.
Come on, let's get out of here.

771
00:44:17,856 --> 00:44:21,811
You, fucking, bit me!
I'll kill you, you hear me?

772
00:44:22,202 --> 00:44:24,010
Arno. What is happening?

773
00:44:24,010 --> 00:44:26,263
Don't Arno me, 
don't, fucking, state my name.

774
00:44:26,808 --> 00:44:27,825
Give me the keys.

775
00:44:27,825 --> 00:44:29,698
The, fucking, Jew bit me.

776
00:44:29,698 --> 00:44:32,340
Hey, what's happening right now?

777
00:44:32,494 --> 00:44:35,232
I told you how things are gonna go, 
if you didn't start to behave.

778
00:44:35,232 --> 00:44:38,833
What? How was I not behaving?
Explain to me, I'm sorry.

779
00:44:38,833 --> 00:44:42,546
I think I was very explicit on the phone 
about how things are gonna go.

780
00:44:42,642 --> 00:44:44,601
You like the way 
things are going now?

781
00:44:44,601 --> 00:44:46,379
Give me the, fucking, keys 
to your car, man!

782
00:44:46,379 --> 00:44:48,992
What are you gonna do?
Have them steal my Mercedes?

783
00:44:49,207 --> 00:44:51,428
Look what, the fuck, you did, 
you, fucking, bit me.

784
00:44:52,007 --> 00:44:53,563
Arno. Fucking talk to me.

785
00:44:53,563 --> 00:44:55,911
Don't listen to him, Arno, 
that's not a game.

786
00:44:55,911 --> 00:44:57,392
- Arno.
- Don't say my, fucking, name!

787
00:44:57,903 --> 00:45:00,662
I have every intention 
of paying you back.

788
00:45:00,779 --> 00:45:02,162
I'm broke right now.

789
00:45:02,162 --> 00:45:03,525
You're broke?
What's that one?

790
00:45:03,525 --> 00:45:05,847
Look at that, do you remember that?
Look at it!

791
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:08,821
That is money, that's not mine.

792
00:45:08,958 --> 00:45:12,261
That I sent to you 
because I wanted to calm you down.

793
00:45:12,261 --> 00:45:15,224
We know for a fact, 
that you placed a bet with that money.

794
00:45:15,499 --> 00:45:18,188
- I never placed a bet with that money.
- Yes, you did.

795
00:45:18,390 --> 00:45:19,953
- No, I didn't.
- No, let me ask you something.

796
00:45:19,953 --> 00:45:22,311
I heard that Beni and Eddie 
are going to Timberlake.

797
00:45:22,311 --> 00:45:25,455
And you know what else I heard? 
I heard you've resurfaced your, fucking, swimming pool.

798
00:45:25,976 --> 00:45:27,148
You know how that makes me feel?

799
00:45:27,148 --> 00:45:29,342
- I've never resurfaced anything.
- You think your life is more important than mine?

800
00:45:29,342 --> 00:45:32,577
- I don't know who said that.
- Give me the keys and shut the fuck up!

801
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,337
Give me the keys to your, fucking, car!

802
00:45:34,337 --> 00:45:36,986
I'll give you, fucking, keys, fine.

803
00:45:37,826 --> 00:45:40,333
All right, listen.
I do. I did.

804
00:45:40,467 --> 00:45:42,330
I admit it, I...

805
00:45:42,330 --> 00:45:45,457
I made a bet.
And guess what?

806
00:45:46,232 --> 00:45:47,675
Here's the thing. I hit.

807
00:45:47,847 --> 00:45:50,353
I hit the bet big, okay?

808
00:45:50,353 --> 00:45:51,844
You think I'm stupid?

809
00:45:52,126 --> 00:45:54,958
You think I'm stupid, Howard.
You and your whole, fucking, family.

810
00:45:55,095 --> 00:45:58,254
I'll call the book right now, 
you'll get on the phone, and he'll tell you.

811
00:45:58,254 --> 00:46:00,985
I saw your bookie, 
you are talking about Gary?

812
00:46:00,985 --> 00:46:03,264
You spoke to Gary?
About what?

813
00:46:03,264 --> 00:46:07,323
About you. About how you're taking my money.
All of the time and placing bets.

814
00:46:07,323 --> 00:46:08,928
You know what that does to me?

815
00:46:08,928 --> 00:46:11,032
You know how offensive it is to me?

816
00:46:11,287 --> 00:46:13,446
What? You stopped the bet?

817
00:46:14,404 --> 00:46:15,613
What do you think, asshole?

818
00:46:15,613 --> 00:46:17,613
- You stopped the bet?
- Shut the fuck up!

819
00:46:19,671 --> 00:46:24,018
Congratulations, Arno, you, 
fucked, ourselves out of six hundred...

820
00:46:26,085 --> 00:46:27,822
Take his clothes off.

821
00:46:30,147 --> 00:46:31,731
What's this?

822
00:46:31,731 --> 00:46:33,752
Give me your, fucking, shirt!

823
00:46:33,752 --> 00:46:35,541
This worth more than my, fucking, car.

824
00:46:36,886 --> 00:46:38,376
Howard, you did this to yourself.

825
00:46:38,376 --> 00:46:39,158
Take his fucking shoes.

826
00:46:39,158 --> 00:46:40,676
I will get you the money.

827
00:46:43,745 --> 00:46:47,252
I'll get the money for you.
I got the...

828
00:46:47,416 --> 00:46:49,946
... rip me off 
to this next fucking week...

829
00:46:49,946 --> 00:46:52,380
Give me my glasses.
I need my, fucking, glasses.

830
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:53,853
Shut the fuck up!

831
00:46:54,870 --> 00:46:56,682
Pull up right here.
Come on, let's go.

832
00:46:56,682 --> 00:47:00,025
At each place you'll be, motherfucker.
Know that I want the money.

833
00:47:00,025 --> 00:47:02,765
Arno gets the money.
I'm not, fucking, around here.

834
00:47:02,765 --> 00:47:04,002
You hear me?

835
00:47:04,002 --> 00:47:05,898
Get him out of the car!

836
00:47:08,626 --> 00:47:10,938
Come on, come on.
Let's go. Let's go.

837
00:47:10,938 --> 00:47:12,342
Arno!

838
00:47:12,746 --> 00:47:14,035
Get in the fucking car.

839
00:47:14,035 --> 00:47:15,333
All right, all right.

840
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:17,342
Listen to me, Arno!

841
00:47:17,342 --> 00:47:19,181
- Arno!
- Get in the car!

842
00:47:19,181 --> 00:47:21,026
- Take the opal.
- Don't worry about that.

843
00:47:21,196 --> 00:47:22,769
Don't worry about it.
Get in the car.

844
00:47:22,769 --> 00:47:24,101
No, I want the underwear.

845
00:47:24,855 --> 00:47:25,788
No, no!

846
00:47:25,788 --> 00:47:28,151
Come here. Come here.
Give me your, fucking, underwear.

847
00:47:30,213 --> 00:47:31,376
You cocksucker.

848
00:47:33,457 --> 00:47:34,899
Let him, fucking, rot in there.

849
00:47:35,085 --> 00:47:39,427
Fuck you, Arno!
You cocksucking motherfucker!

850
00:47:42,870 --> 00:47:46,609
Help!

851
00:47:50,648 --> 00:47:52,261
Are you fucking...

852
00:47:55,496 --> 00:47:57,239
Please.

853
00:47:57,239 --> 00:47:59,698
Pick up that phone.

854
00:48:03,683 --> 00:48:04,716
Come on. Come on.

855
00:48:04,716 --> 00:48:07,159
Howard, where are you?
Marcel is about to go on stage.

856
00:48:07,159 --> 00:48:08,618
- Dinah!
- What do you want?

857
00:48:08,618 --> 00:48:11,656
I locked my keys in the trunk of the car.
Can you please...

858
00:48:11,656 --> 00:48:14,426
Can you come to the parking lot 
and open it for me?

859
00:48:19,846 --> 00:48:23,155
Fucking shit!
Fuck.

860
00:48:34,045 --> 00:48:36,515
It's okay. Thank you.
Okay?

861
00:48:39,111 --> 00:48:42,897
Sorry. I'll meet you right back inside.
It's all good now.

862
00:48:42,897 --> 00:48:45,160
Let me get dressed.

863
00:49:02,038 --> 00:49:06,447
<i>What could you possibly be looking for
in the forest, dressed in such thin paper rags?</i>

864
00:49:06,657 --> 00:49:08,933
<i>My wicked stepmother 
has condemned me to die,</i>

865
00:49:08,933 --> 00:49:12,385
<i>lest I fill this basket with roses 
before the coming of the dawn.</i>

866
00:49:13,672 --> 00:49:16,423
<i>Besides our cottage is our magic garden.</i>

867
00:49:16,423 --> 00:49:18,899
<i>It protects the roses from the snow.</i>

868
00:49:19,546 --> 00:49:22,652
<i>Go now and fill your basket 
to your heart’s content.</i>

869
00:49:22,652 --> 00:49:25,340
- Dad, what the fuck?
- Just watch you, fucking, sister's play.

870
00:49:26,064 --> 00:49:30,517
<i>Thank you!</i>

871
00:49:30,977 --> 00:49:33,575
<i>We must bestow a gift upon her!</i>

872
00:49:33,575 --> 00:49:40,015
<i>I know! Every time she speaks, 
gold coins shall spill forth from her mouth.</i>

873
00:49:40,015 --> 00:49:41,742
<i>This will be our gift!</i>

874
00:49:41,742 --> 00:49:44,036
<i>Quick! He approaches now.</i>

875
00:49:48,435 --> 00:49:50,420
This is Danny's part, 
he's coming out.

876
00:49:50,501 --> 00:49:52,773
<i>Hark! Who goes there?</i>

877
00:49:53,476 --> 00:49:54,604
He did so good.

878
00:50:02,964 --> 00:50:06,268
Fuck me. Jesus Christ.

879
00:50:08,058 --> 00:50:10,316
- Hello.
- Hey, you picked up?

880
00:50:11,306 --> 00:50:14,036
When I block the caller you pick up,
when you know it's me you don't?

881
00:50:14,036 --> 00:50:15,425
What is that all about?

882
00:50:15,996 --> 00:50:18,903
Nah, I knew it was you, Howard
that’s why I picked up.

883
00:50:19,531 --> 00:50:21,428
Hey, where’s my, fucking, gem?

884
00:50:21,594 --> 00:50:25,095
Hey, you need to calm down.
Nothing’s happening with you acting like this.

885
00:50:25,095 --> 00:50:26,139
Listen motherfucker.

886
00:50:26,139 --> 00:50:28,465
I want my, fucking, property, 
you understand me?

887
00:50:28,465 --> 00:50:30,226
Hey, watch your mouth, all right?

888
00:50:30,462 --> 00:50:32,309
You’re not dealing
with some broke ass niggas.

889
00:50:32,843 --> 00:50:36,584
You, fucking, put me on that bus ride home.
You think that was funny?

890
00:50:36,584 --> 00:50:39,958
What, the fuck, was that all about?
That, fucking, bus was disgusting!

891
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:41,401
What explaining you want me to do?

892
00:50:41,401 --> 00:50:45,862
I'd go with you to locker-room, with your silly ass 
it makes me look really, fucking, suspect.

893
00:50:45,862 --> 00:50:48,710
- Where's my gem? Where is it?
- I’m trying to help you, not fuck everything up.

894
00:50:48,884 --> 00:50:51,142
Jesus. I have it on me, right now.

895
00:50:51,142 --> 00:50:52,648
You have it on you?

896
00:50:53,176 --> 00:50:55,431
Yes, I’m about to 
be back in the city.

897
00:50:55,576 --> 00:50:59,073
Okay, you're going to this, fucking, 
Weeknd thing tonight?

898
00:51:00,687 --> 00:51:03,264
I wasn't planning on it, 
but I could.

899
00:51:03,375 --> 00:51:07,013
You could? No it's not you could.
You will! You'll meet me there.

900
00:51:25,946 --> 00:51:28,476
Smells good, what it is?
Barbecue chicken?

901
00:51:34,739 --> 00:51:37,746
So, I wanted to talk about 
the trunk scenario.

902
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:40,294
It was, literally, 
the most awkward thing, like...

903
00:51:42,177 --> 00:51:43,443
Where are you going?

904
00:51:43,443 --> 00:51:45,293
I'm heading into the city.

905
00:51:46,367 --> 00:51:48,001
Late night event.

906
00:51:48,001 --> 00:51:50,195
- Kinda go...
- It's the cake?

907
00:51:50,195 --> 00:51:55,249
Until 2, 3, you never know anymore.
So, I'll be exhausted tomorrow.

908
00:51:55,249 --> 00:51:56,944
Yeah, okay, sure.

909
00:52:05,910 --> 00:52:07,305
Good night.

910
00:52:09,665 --> 00:52:13,869
Anyway, I'll finish the conversation later,
but it was, literally, so awkward, like...

911
00:52:14,237 --> 00:52:15,783
Who are you talking to?

912
00:52:16,643 --> 00:52:17,694
Jessica.

913
00:52:17,694 --> 00:52:20,634
Hi Jessica.
How good was our girl tonight?

914
00:52:20,634 --> 00:52:22,265
You can't hear her.

915
00:52:22,265 --> 00:52:27,806
Okay, then, just hang up for a second, 
let me talk to you, 2 secs.

916
00:52:27,876 --> 00:52:29,679
I'll call you back.

917
00:52:30,343 --> 00:52:31,786
What?

918
00:52:32,741 --> 00:52:36,123
I was very proud of you tonight.
You were beyond incredible.

919
00:52:36,123 --> 00:52:37,950
Yeah, you told me like 5 times already.

920
00:52:37,950 --> 00:52:39,924
Well, I just wanted to...

921
00:52:40,094 --> 00:52:43,042
You really really didn't know 
how proud I was, okay?

922
00:52:43,042 --> 00:52:45,829
So I really, I just really really 
want you to know.

923
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:47,440
Okay, well, I do.

924
00:52:49,195 --> 00:52:51,103
Everything is cool, right?

925
00:52:51,103 --> 00:52:52,320
What do you mean?

926
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:55,002
I don't know, I just.
Thought I would check in with you.

927
00:52:55,215 --> 00:52:56,586
Okay.

928
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:59,127
Make sure everything's good.

929
00:52:59,752 --> 00:53:01,234
Why wouldn't I be good?

930
00:53:01,234 --> 00:53:03,367
I don't know, 
I just thought I'd check in.

931
00:53:03,367 --> 00:53:06,392
Okay, well, I, literally, don't know 
what you are talking about, so...

932
00:53:06,392 --> 00:53:08,796
That's right, 'cause I'm an idiot.

933
00:53:09,618 --> 00:53:14,034
So you love me.
Okay I'm gonna get into the city.

934
00:53:14,034 --> 00:53:16,383
- I'll see you in the morning.
- Have fun.

935
00:53:16,653 --> 00:53:18,214
Like I always do.

936
00:53:18,214 --> 00:53:19,902
Anyway, what were I saying?

937
00:53:19,902 --> 00:53:22,901
You know it was like a 
complete resting bitch face, so...

938
00:53:41,371 --> 00:53:43,892
Hey, Demany, where...

939
00:53:44,493 --> 00:53:47,483
I didn't see you out front, 
I don't, fucking, see you in here now.

940
00:53:48,176 --> 00:53:50,384
I can't believe I'm still 
looking for you.

941
00:53:51,330 --> 00:53:56,434
Just, pick up your, fucking, phone, man. 
I don't understand this!

942
00:53:57,314 --> 00:53:58,910
Don't fuck with me here.

943
00:54:01,901 --> 00:54:04,048
Hold on.

944
00:54:04,048 --> 00:54:05,534
Stop the music.

945
00:54:05,534 --> 00:54:07,145
Stop!

946
00:54:07,844 --> 00:54:10,063
Would somebody pass 
the Weeknd the mic?

947
00:54:10,469 --> 00:54:12,113
Where, the fuck, is the blacklight?

948
00:54:12,113 --> 00:54:13,795
What's going on back there?

949
00:54:13,795 --> 00:54:15,105
No, I asked for blacklight.

950
00:54:15,105 --> 00:54:18,516
I'm not performing till it's, 
fucking, blacklight on this, fucking, stage.

951
00:54:18,516 --> 00:54:20,031
Call out the blacklight.

952
00:54:20,031 --> 00:54:22,234
Blacklight.

953
00:54:22,234 --> 00:54:24,815
Close on with the Weeknd to those, 
who turn on the blacklight.

954
00:54:26,849 --> 00:54:28,431
Blacklight.

955
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:30,911
What's going on back there?

956
00:54:31,401 --> 00:54:32,585
I'm puzzled.

957
00:54:38,456 --> 00:54:39,850
That's what I'm talking about.

958
00:54:53,374 --> 00:54:56,306
Hey, Demany!

959
00:54:58,125 --> 00:55:00,437
Demany!

960
00:55:00,844 --> 00:55:03,761
Howard, I want you to meet,
my nigga, James.

961
00:55:05,222 --> 00:55:06,561
I've been hearing about you.

962
00:55:06,708 --> 00:55:08,168
Yo, where's that opal?

963
00:55:10,441 --> 00:55:11,537
I just need the opal.

964
00:55:12,686 --> 00:55:14,598
- What?
- The opal. Give me the opal.

965
00:55:14,774 --> 00:55:15,668
Oh. I don’t have it.

966
00:55:15,863 --> 00:55:18,113
You don't mind to shot me 
anytime you want.

967
00:55:19,819 --> 00:55:20,590
What did you say? Where is it?

968
00:55:20,590 --> 00:55:22,465
Out of story. I don’t have it.

969
00:55:22,834 --> 00:55:24,583
You don't have it, 
what do you mean?

970
00:55:24,699 --> 00:55:28,141
- KG got it, I don't have it.
- KG has? What the fuck are you talking about?

971
00:55:28,141 --> 00:55:30,225
You said on the phone you have it.

972
00:55:30,225 --> 00:55:32,247
Hey, change.
Man, I don't want this shit.

973
00:55:32,268 --> 00:55:34,506
Why, the fuck, are you here, 
if you don't have the opal?

974
00:55:34,528 --> 00:55:38,689
Same, fucking, reason as everybody else is here, 
to see the, fucking, Weeknd perform.

975
00:55:38,911 --> 00:55:39,800
You got a problem with that?

976
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:42,009
I got a very big problem with that.

977
00:55:42,652 --> 00:55:44,153
We gave it for one day.

978
00:55:45,738 --> 00:55:48,036
What, the fuck, is wrong with you?
Calm your ass down.

979
00:55:49,108 --> 00:55:50,630
The fuck do you think this is?

980
00:55:52,884 --> 00:55:54,071
You good?

981
00:55:54,288 --> 00:55:56,415
I'm good. I'm good.

982
00:55:57,356 --> 00:55:59,064
Take the, fucking, drink, man.

983
00:56:20,803 --> 00:56:23,006
- What the fuck?
- Hey, fuck you, nigga.

984
00:56:57,078 --> 00:56:59,317
- It's on your face.
- It's okay, baby.

985
00:56:59,489 --> 00:57:01,398
- Is it off?
- Yeah, right there.

986
00:57:04,410 --> 00:57:05,758
What are you doing?

987
00:57:06,028 --> 00:57:07,142
Julia, what are you doing?

988
00:57:07,142 --> 00:57:09,932
No touching.

989
00:57:11,002 --> 00:57:12,905
I wanna fuck you so bad.

990
00:57:13,999 --> 00:57:15,260
How bad?

991
00:57:16,179 --> 00:57:17,417
I'll show you.

992
00:57:18,446 --> 00:57:19,247
I said no touching.

993
00:57:19,247 --> 00:57:21,129
Give that, fucking, ass.
Feel this shit. Feel this.

994
00:57:21,703 --> 00:57:23,446
Oh my God!

995
00:57:24,559 --> 00:57:27,026
How are you even 
this hard right now?

996
00:57:28,001 --> 00:57:30,137
Slow down. 
Where are you going?

997
00:57:30,736 --> 00:57:32,282
I was already inside.

998
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:34,124
Listen, I don't remember 
seeing you inside.

999
00:57:34,124 --> 00:57:36,873
I’m friends with The Weeknd,
He told me to come after his set.

1000
00:57:37,112 --> 00:57:40,390
- Hey, Flawless, Flawless.
- Listen, watch the yelling!

1001
00:57:40,588 --> 00:57:42,832
- Screaming over here...
- Yo, yo!

1002
00:57:43,141 --> 00:57:45,742
- Yo, use the phone!
- Help me, this guy won't let me in!

1003
00:57:45,742 --> 00:57:46,906
Come here!

1004
00:57:46,906 --> 00:57:52,058
- The legend is in the, motherfucking, building.
- Come here, you gotta let me through.

1005
00:57:52,415 --> 00:57:53,634
Let him in.

1006
00:57:53,634 --> 00:57:55,417
- You know him?
- Sorry man, yeah, that's my guy.

1007
00:57:55,417 --> 00:57:56,926
What's up, sexy?

1008
00:57:56,926 --> 00:57:57,828
How are we doing?

1009
00:57:57,828 --> 00:58:01,321
Hey, check this out, you see this 
Rolls-Royce that I did in Miami?

1010
00:58:01,646 --> 00:58:03,646
Yeah, Richie showed me all kinds of shit.

1011
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:05,844
Where is Julia?
Is she in there?

1012
00:58:05,844 --> 00:58:07,160
Yeah, she's back there somewhere.

1013
00:58:07,867 --> 00:58:10,024
Do you know what's going on 
with my Michael Jackson pendant?

1014
00:58:10,024 --> 00:58:11,266
What about that?

1015
00:58:11,266 --> 00:58:12,813
What do you mean what about that?
I need it back.

1016
00:58:12,813 --> 00:58:15,197
- It's in my safe.
- I'll come by tomorrow to pick it up.

1017
00:58:15,197 --> 00:58:17,323
She's trying to sell 
this thing to the Weekend.

1018
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:18,818
- You understand?
- Yeah.

1019
00:58:18,818 --> 00:58:19,960
What do you mean "yeah"?

1020
00:58:20,957 --> 00:58:22,401
Where is she now?

1021
00:58:22,401 --> 00:58:25,145
- Yeah.
- But where?

1022
00:58:27,005 --> 00:58:27,824
Where?

1023
00:58:27,824 --> 00:58:30,101
I don't mean to get in you business,
I don't wanna get involved,

1024
00:58:30,101 --> 00:58:32,605
but I saw her go to 
bathroom with Weeknd.

1025
00:58:40,035 --> 00:58:40,933
Julia!

1026
00:58:40,933 --> 00:58:42,554
- Oh shit!
- Julia, are you in there?

1027
00:58:42,786 --> 00:58:44,100
Yo, I said to hold the door, bro.

1028
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:45,373
Open up the door!

1029
00:58:45,432 --> 00:58:47,667
- Someone's in it.
- Shut the fuck up!

1030
00:58:47,849 --> 00:58:49,964
Give me one second, 
I need to wash my hands.

1031
00:58:50,018 --> 00:58:52,000
- What the fuck is this?
- Howard we were just doing coke.

1032
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,244
Nothing happened!

1033
00:58:53,678 --> 00:58:55,355
Let go!
Let go off me!

1034
00:58:58,052 --> 00:58:59,289
Get off him!

1035
00:59:10,038 --> 00:59:11,884
Stop fighting!

1036
00:59:11,884 --> 00:59:13,917
Hey, get, the fuck, back off me!

1037
00:59:14,388 --> 00:59:15,679
Fuck you!

1038
00:59:16,328 --> 00:59:18,344
Fuck that, motherfucker, right there!

1039
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:21,375
Shut the fuck up!

1040
00:59:21,375 --> 00:59:23,158
I'm so sorry, Howard.

1041
00:59:23,158 --> 00:59:24,979
Fuck you!

1042
00:59:25,638 --> 00:59:27,590
Let's go!
Get the fuck out!

1043
00:59:27,921 --> 00:59:31,588
You tell the, fucking, guy he's sued.
He's getting sued.

1044
00:59:32,986 --> 00:59:38,142
Not one, fucking, DJ gonna play his shit.
I know every, fucking, DJ in this town.

1045
00:59:38,580 --> 00:59:40,118
Fuck all you losers!

1046
00:59:40,624 --> 00:59:42,729
You smell like 
his, fucking, cologne!

1047
00:59:43,146 --> 00:59:45,184
We didn't do anything, Howard!

1048
00:59:45,184 --> 00:59:46,844
Yeah, right, right!

1049
00:59:49,291 --> 00:59:52,441
You blew a huge, 
fucking, sale for me!

1050
00:59:52,509 --> 00:59:54,864
What were you selling,
your, fucking, hot snatch?

1051
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:58,661
Blowing my whole, fucking, life away 
for this skank over here.

1052
00:59:58,685 --> 01:00:01,880
Oh, wow, okay.
Now I'm a, fucking, skank?

1053
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:03,931
- Were, the fuck, are you, you fuck?
- Listen, Howard.

1054
01:00:03,931 --> 01:00:06,401
You knew what, the fuck, it was 
when you met me.

1055
01:00:06,401 --> 01:00:07,820
That's right, yeah.
That's right.

1056
01:00:07,820 --> 01:00:10,389
That’s why I wish I never, fucking, met you.
Right here.

1057
01:00:10,389 --> 01:00:15,023
- Oh wow, that's great Howard, Howard.
- Get out of my, fucking, way!

1058
01:00:15,321 --> 01:00:17,043
Go fuck the Weeknd.

1059
01:00:17,043 --> 01:00:19,804
- We didn't, fucking, do anything!
- Fuck off me!

1060
01:00:19,804 --> 01:00:23,359
Go, go. It's fine. Go.
Good night. Bye. Get, the fuck, away!

1061
01:00:23,456 --> 01:00:25,160
- Howard.
- Go!

1062
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:27,834
Howard.

1063
01:00:27,834 --> 01:00:29,298
Howard. Get out of, the fucking, car!

1064
01:00:29,298 --> 01:00:31,520
Get, the fuck, out of the way!

1065
01:00:32,145 --> 01:00:35,462
What are you gonna do, Howard?
What are you gonna do, big tough guy?

1066
01:00:35,462 --> 01:00:38,708
- I didn't, fucking, do anything with him?
- Get, the fuck, out of here!

1067
01:00:38,709 --> 01:00:40,755
Get, the fuck, away!
Go fuck the guy!

1068
01:00:40,894 --> 01:00:43,839
Fuck you, Howard!
I'll see you tomorrow.

1069
01:00:43,874 --> 01:00:46,302
I'll see you tomorrow, Howard!

1070
01:00:46,692 --> 01:00:49,552
Let's go. Go!
Fuck you!

1071
01:01:23,755 --> 01:01:25,596
What, the fuck, are you looking at?

1072
01:01:26,164 --> 01:01:27,528
Nothing much.

1073
01:01:27,827 --> 01:01:30,117
Oh, funny. Stupid bitch.

1074
01:01:30,704 --> 01:01:33,410
That's why you're in line 
in the, fucking, cold.

1075
01:01:33,563 --> 01:01:34,992
Stupid bitch.

1076
01:03:05,668 --> 01:03:08,309
- No, no, no. Listen, Anne.
- Howard, Howard.

1077
01:03:08,309 --> 01:03:10,657
I'm looking at it.
I'm looking at the opal.

1078
01:03:10,657 --> 01:03:13,253
- You are missing the point.
- I'm looking at it right now, okay?

1079
01:03:13,253 --> 01:03:14,182
It's gorgeous.

1080
01:03:14,182 --> 01:03:16,456
It is not you who should be 
looking at it, it's me.

1081
01:03:16,456 --> 01:03:17,465
Turn that down.

1082
01:03:17,465 --> 01:03:19,455
Let me explain 
something to you, Mr. Ratner.

1083
01:03:19,455 --> 01:03:23,534
Your opal is one of the 75 items 
I have to oversee for this auction.

1084
01:03:23,534 --> 01:03:27,020
All of them but yours have been cleaned, 
cataloged and appraised.

1085
01:03:27,020 --> 01:03:29,386
Listen, I'm doing some appraisals 
of my own, okay?

1086
01:03:29,481 --> 01:03:31,390
And then I’m gonna
bring it to you today.

1087
01:03:31,390 --> 01:03:33,057
I am on the precipice of pulling it.

1088
01:03:33,057 --> 01:03:36,183
- I swear to you, please, okay?
- End of the day or we’re done.

1089
01:03:36,183 --> 01:03:40,059
I'm getting a call right now, 
so I have to go.

1090
01:03:41,544 --> 01:03:43,544
This is Howard Ratner.
Hi, Janet, thank you so much

1091
01:03:43,850 --> 01:03:45,587
- for calling me back so quickly.
- Yeah, no problem.

1092
01:03:45,587 --> 01:03:47,917
That message you left 
was actually very disturbing.

1093
01:03:48,199 --> 01:03:49,882
No, I didn't mean to worry you.

1094
01:03:49,882 --> 01:03:51,881
Okay, would you mind telling 
me what this is about?

1095
01:03:51,881 --> 01:03:55,073
I saw online that your boss 
represents Kevin Garnett?

1096
01:03:55,211 --> 01:03:58,267
- I'm gonna have to put you on hold for one moment.
- Okay, sure, I'll hang on.

1097
01:03:58,359 --> 01:04:03,239
- Howard, Julia's on line 1.
- No. No, tell her no. I'm not here.

1098
01:04:03,397 --> 01:04:05,182
Fuck it!

1099
01:04:07,322 --> 01:04:08,263
Where are you?

1100
01:04:08,263 --> 01:04:10,147
Why aren't you answering your phone?

1101
01:04:10,764 --> 01:04:12,559
I asked you a question,
where are you?

1102
01:04:12,707 --> 01:04:14,812
I stayed at Kat’s house, 
where else do you think?

1103
01:04:14,812 --> 01:04:17,358
I couldn’t, fucking, go home 
with you acting that way.

1104
01:04:17,358 --> 01:04:18,328
No, that's...

1105
01:04:18,328 --> 01:04:20,538
So, let me guess, 
you're not coming to work today?

1106
01:04:20,762 --> 01:04:21,643
I would like to.

1107
01:04:21,643 --> 01:04:24,839
That must be nice to 
come to work whenever you feel like it.

1108
01:04:25,317 --> 01:04:28,359
- Howard.
- Is that good, is that good?

1109
01:04:28,508 --> 01:04:30,391
Maybe, you should take a nap then?

1110
01:04:30,763 --> 01:04:32,426
- Can't we just...
- Take a nap, get your rest...

1111
01:04:32,426 --> 01:04:35,124
 you need to remain attractive, right?

1112
01:04:37,081 --> 01:04:38,524
Answer me.

1113
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:40,782
I just wanna sit down 
and talk to you, Howard.

1114
01:04:40,782 --> 01:04:41,601
- Okay.
- I don't wanna do this right now.

1115
01:04:41,601 --> 01:04:44,045
- I don't wanna play.
- And I just need to work, okay?

1116
01:04:44,045 --> 01:04:47,574
I need to work to make sure 
that your cheating ass is taking care of.

1117
01:04:47,578 --> 01:04:49,798
- ... personnel on line 2.
- Goodbye!

1118
01:04:51,086 --> 01:04:52,372
This is Howard Ratner.

1119
01:04:52,372 --> 01:04:54,504
My assistant told me that you called?
How are you doing?

1120
01:04:54,664 --> 01:04:56,621
I'm not gonna lie to you,
I could be better.

1121
01:04:56,746 --> 01:04:58,593
Sorry to hear that,
so what can I do for you?

1122
01:04:58,593 --> 01:05:02,489
I've been having a situation 
with one of your higher profile players.

1123
01:05:02,489 --> 01:05:06,690
And I'm moments away right now 
from making things very ugly for you.

1124
01:05:06,690 --> 01:05:09,359
- Okay, can you hang on for a second?
- No, I'm not hanging on.

1125
01:05:09,359 --> 01:05:12,204
I happen to be a litigious individual,

1126
01:05:12,305 --> 01:05:15,322
and I'm a second away 
from hanging up right now

1127
01:05:15,465 --> 01:05:17,876
- and calling my lawyer and the police...
- Whoa, whoah, whoah.

1128
01:05:17,876 --> 01:05:20,421
- You realize I have no idea what you’re talking about.
- Howard, KG is here with Demany.

1129
01:05:20,421 --> 01:05:22,439
You’re getting very hot very fast and
you’re starting to sound like an asshole so

1130
01:05:22,439 --> 01:05:24,554
- maybe you wanna back off...
- Nevermind.

1131
01:05:27,064 --> 01:05:29,573
Kevin, hey.

1132
01:05:32,081 --> 01:05:33,474
Buzz the men in.

1133
01:05:35,445 --> 01:05:37,675
- Buzz them.
- I am. I am, Howard.

1134
01:05:37,836 --> 01:05:39,229
That's the fucking door.

1135
01:05:39,229 --> 01:05:41,819
Got to the other buzzer, please.
Hurry up.

1136
01:05:42,735 --> 01:05:44,526
I'll be right there.
Go ahead.

1137
01:05:45,208 --> 01:05:47,625
- That's not working.
- Goddamnit!

1138
01:05:47,834 --> 01:05:48,874
Goddamnit!

1139
01:05:48,981 --> 01:05:51,120
- Hang up, sorry.
- Open this shit, man.

1140
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:53,049
- I'm sorry.
- We don't have time for this shit.

1141
01:05:53,049 --> 01:05:55,300
- Magnets sometimes...
- I don't give a fuck about that.

1142
01:05:55,479 --> 01:05:57,512
- You brought the gem?
- I'm claustrophobic.

1143
01:05:57,512 --> 01:06:00,593
- Oh, yeah, I got the gem right here.
- Okay, all right, good, there it is.

1144
01:06:00,750 --> 01:06:01,740
We'll go upstairs and wait.

1145
01:06:01,740 --> 01:06:03,998
You can't leave, 
because that one is locked over.

1146
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:06,889
Get a, fucking, 
hammer over there.

1147
01:06:07,037 --> 01:06:09,414
Roman, he needs the hammer.
He needs the hammer.

1148
01:06:09,428 --> 01:06:11,033
Let me get a hammer.

1149
01:06:12,739 --> 01:06:15,146
I, actually, don't know how 
this will work, but...

1150
01:06:15,649 --> 01:06:17,744
- Give me the hammer.
- I'm on it, I'm coming.

1151
01:06:17,744 --> 01:06:20,548
It usually works.
This will work. Give me this.

1152
01:06:20,987 --> 01:06:22,517
And get ready to buzz, okay?

1153
01:06:22,777 --> 01:06:24,881
- Oh my God, nigga!
- I'm sorry, buzz, buzz.

1154
01:06:25,351 --> 01:06:27,882
- That shit is louder than bitch.
- Are you fucking kidding me?

1155
01:06:28,775 --> 01:06:29,745
Gotta hit it from the side.

1156
01:06:29,745 --> 01:06:32,175
- Flawless is here.
- Get rid of this motherfucker.

1157
01:06:32,685 --> 01:06:34,480
- Tell him to vibe.
- Oh my God, Flawless is here?

1158
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:37,140
Defy, the fucking, Flawless!
Roman!

1159
01:06:37,777 --> 01:06:40,628
- Roman! Come on here.
- Oh, shit!

1160
01:06:40,628 --> 01:06:43,189
All right, listen, we're having 
a, fucking, connection issue.

1161
01:06:43,189 --> 01:06:47,604
Just get me some, fucking, metal shavings 
and the tool, fucking, kit, all right?

1162
01:06:48,163 --> 01:06:49,987
Goddamnit!

1163
01:06:50,996 --> 01:06:54,519
I'm going to get this...
I promise you this will work.

1164
01:06:54,519 --> 01:06:56,195
Hurry the fuck up, Roman!
Thank you.

1165
01:06:57,131 --> 01:07:00,895
Hey, Howard. I'm here to buy the opal.
This is a game day for me!

1166
01:07:00,895 --> 01:07:03,505
- I know, I know it is.
- What the fuck is going on?

1167
01:07:03,505 --> 01:07:05,948
- I got 175 thousand in this bag.
- 175?

1168
01:07:05,948 --> 01:07:08,576
I told you that thing's worth 
over a million dollars, that's...

1169
01:07:08,576 --> 01:07:11,295
Howard, come on, man!
What the fuck are you doing?

1170
01:07:11,295 --> 01:07:13,042
... Court-side seats.

1171
01:07:13,057 --> 01:07:16,579
I live in New York, I don't know 
what’s that gonna do me, KG?

1172
01:07:16,995 --> 01:07:19,555
I wanna give you to you for free, 
I'm that kind of guy.

1173
01:07:19,705 --> 01:07:21,475
Just... I'm tied into an auction.

1174
01:07:21,475 --> 01:07:22,679
What are talking...
What auction?

1175
01:07:22,679 --> 01:07:24,777
The auction...
Listen, make a bid.

1176
01:07:24,777 --> 01:07:26,324
- Make a bid at the auction.
- When is it?

1177
01:07:26,324 --> 01:07:27,437
- It's Monday.
- Monday.

1178
01:07:27,577 --> 01:07:30,578
- Nah, let him rent it for a couple nights.
- I can't.

1179
01:07:30,578 --> 01:07:33,251
I’ll just hold it till Monday, 
you'll get it back Monday night.

1180
01:07:33,251 --> 01:07:36,971
- Kevin, I hate letting you down.
- This dude fucking says "no" to everything.

1181
01:07:37,219 --> 01:07:39,188
- Say "yes" to something.
- I want to, Kevin.

1182
01:07:39,188 --> 01:07:41,985
I fucking love ya.
I feel like an asshole, believe me.

1183
01:07:42,696 --> 01:07:46,757
Come down, let me, fucking, do this.
Jesus, fucking... I got this.

1184
01:07:47,027 --> 01:07:49,600
Godd, fucking, damnit.
I gotta do everything.

1185
01:07:49,809 --> 01:07:52,513
Please, stop knocking.
It's not gonna help.

1186
01:07:52,513 --> 01:07:54,013
Go. Go.

1187
01:07:54,626 --> 01:07:56,814
- I'm so, goddamnit, sorry.
- Jesus Christ!

1188
01:07:58,911 --> 01:08:00,883
Get them some water.
Get the cold water.

1189
01:08:00,883 --> 01:08:02,048
We don't need any water, man.

1190
01:08:02,048 --> 01:08:03,834
Go get my ring, man,
so I can get the hell out of here.

1191
01:08:03,834 --> 01:08:05,875
Get him his fucking ring. 
He’s got shit to do, come on!

1192
01:08:05,875 --> 01:08:09,149
- Oh, the ring, the ring...
- He's got a game, Howard.

1193
01:08:09,391 --> 01:08:13,153
Oh my God, no, I left the, 
fucking, ring in Long Island.

1194
01:08:13,153 --> 01:08:15,604
What, the fuck, do you mean 
you left it in Long Island?

1195
01:08:15,604 --> 01:08:16,545
I'll give it to Demany.

1196
01:08:16,545 --> 01:08:18,819
- I don't have time for this.
- I'll give it to Demany.

1197
01:08:18,995 --> 01:08:20,396
I'll give it to you.

1198
01:08:20,396 --> 01:08:23,142
Listen, I can't do this.
I don't have time for this.

1199
01:08:23,142 --> 01:08:24,702
You don't have to, 
I do need...

1200
01:08:24,702 --> 01:08:26,763
I know what I need is stone.
I need the stone.

1201
01:08:26,763 --> 01:08:29,253
- You need the stone?
- Where's my ring at though?

1202
01:08:29,363 --> 01:08:31,157
I'll get you the ring,
I'm gonna get it to Demany.

1203
01:08:31,157 --> 01:08:33,905
Give me favor.
Get my ring for me and I'll see you later.

1204
01:08:33,927 --> 01:08:37,130
Howard, this is bullshit.
Open this fucking door.

1205
01:08:37,278 --> 01:08:40,656
Why did we come up here, man?
Buzz us out, Howard.

1206
01:08:40,656 --> 01:08:42,934
We'll buzz you out, all right?
Please, buzz them out.

1207
01:08:43,058 --> 01:08:46,803
KG, forgive everything 
I did and the time I wasted.

1208
01:08:47,053 --> 01:08:50,069
You fucking asshole, 
you fucking did this!

1209
01:08:51,078 --> 01:08:54,127
- What have you been telling him?
- What the fuck are talking about, Howard?

1210
01:08:54,282 --> 01:08:56,506
This how this shit works.
I bring niggas here,

1211
01:08:56,613 --> 01:08:59,062
to you, to buy jewelry.
That's how I get, fucking, paid.

1212
01:08:59,150 --> 01:09:01,112
You got a lot of nerve, 
talking to me right now

1213
01:09:01,112 --> 01:09:03,235
- The fuck you talking about?
- after the fiasco you, fucking, caused.

1214
01:09:03,235 --> 01:09:06,644
That nigga just offered you a quarter 
of a million dollars for a, fucking, rock, dummy.

1215
01:09:06,949 --> 01:09:08,239
- That's all me!
- Of course, it's you, right.

1216
01:09:08,787 --> 01:09:10,236
- And I had nothing to do with it.
- That’s 20 fucking grand...

1217
01:09:10,430 --> 01:09:12,636
You spent for those guys 
in Ethiopia, right?

1218
01:09:12,636 --> 01:09:14,983
You put all those calls in... 
Yeah, my bad.

1219
01:09:15,210 --> 01:09:17,148
Fuck you, my nigga.
I'm taking all my niggas somewhere.

1220
01:09:17,148 --> 01:09:18,764
- Where's my shit at?
- Get the fuck...

1221
01:09:18,764 --> 01:09:20,333
What, the fuck, are you doing?
Get out of here!

1222
01:09:20,333 --> 01:09:21,499
- Where's my shit?
- Get out of here!

1223
01:09:21,499 --> 01:09:23,933
- It's only 3, fucking, watches in here.
- I don't want you in there!

1224
01:09:23,933 --> 01:09:24,968
Where, the fuck, is the rest of my shit?!

1225
01:09:24,968 --> 01:09:27,427
- Where are my watches at, only 3 in here?
- I loaned them. I loaned them.

1226
01:09:27,427 --> 01:09:30,373
- What do you mean you loaned them?
- These are fake Rolex.

1227
01:09:30,373 --> 01:09:33,119
Nigga, that’s my shit! 
Nigga, those boxes are mad expensive!

1228
01:09:33,119 --> 01:09:34,975
- You fucking idiot.
- All right, I owe you then.

1229
01:09:35,161 --> 01:09:37,863
- Get out of here, I said!
- Man, fuck you! Get the fuck off me!

1230
01:09:37,863 --> 01:09:40,624
- Howard, I have Dr. Blauman on line 1.
- Where the fuck is my shit?

1231
01:09:40,624 --> 01:09:41,874
Go ahead. Go ahead.

1232
01:09:41,874 --> 01:09:42,864
Hi!

1233
01:09:43,013 --> 01:09:45,135
- Howard?
- Hi, doctor, what's going on?

1234
01:09:45,939 --> 01:09:47,004
- Howard?
- Yes.

1235
01:09:47,004 --> 01:09:48,639
- Where's the, goddamn, paper, man?
- Please be quiet.

1236
01:09:48,639 --> 01:09:50,291
- Is everything okay?
- Where's the, fucking, paper, Howard?

1237
01:09:50,409 --> 01:09:51,685
Shut, the fuck, up!

1238
01:09:51,685 --> 01:09:54,187
- Howard?
- Go ahead. Go ahead, I'm sorry.

1239
01:09:54,518 --> 01:09:56,597
- Howard...
- What do I got?

1240
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:57,720
Fuck this shit, man.

1241
01:09:57,720 --> 01:10:00,601
I'm looking at the results 
from your colonoscopy.

1242
01:10:00,631 --> 01:10:02,599
So, we're good, you're all good, 
everything came back clean.

1243
01:10:02,599 --> 01:10:07,402
Doctor, all clean a 100%?
You said it's good?

1244
01:10:07,635 --> 01:10:09,676
- Yes, I said you're all clean.
- Oh, good, good, thank you.

1245
01:10:09,676 --> 01:10:12,066
- That's relief.
- Howard, relax, this is just...

1246
01:10:12,595 --> 01:10:14,989
My father, fucking, died from it, so...

1247
01:10:15,161 --> 01:10:19,160
Yeah, I'm sorry I didn't mean to scare you.
But, you know, given your head family history.

1248
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:24,200
I know, Jews and colon cancer, what is that?
I thought we were the chosen people.

1249
01:10:24,521 --> 01:10:26,786
Look, colon cancer just paid 
for my house in the Hamptons...

1250
01:10:26,786 --> 01:10:30,348
Don't tell me that. Where? 
What part of the Hamptons? How many acres?

1251
01:10:30,348 --> 01:10:32,382
What are you doing? 
You gonna kill the fish.

1252
01:10:32,382 --> 01:10:33,328
What the fuck?

1253
01:10:33,328 --> 01:10:35,793
- My fish! My fish!
- Fuck your fish, nigga!

1254
01:10:36,395 --> 01:10:38,517
Get a glass! Get a glass!

1255
01:10:38,788 --> 01:10:41,286
- Fuck your, goddamn, fish, nigga!
- What, the fuck, are you doing?

1256
01:10:41,286 --> 01:10:42,935
You, fucking, asshole!

1257
01:10:42,935 --> 01:10:46,141
Get the, fucking, another glass.
Get another glass, goddamnit!

1258
01:10:46,141 --> 01:10:49,400
Come here, I got you.
Here you go, here you go.

1259
01:10:49,512 --> 01:10:50,825
I got you, sweetheart.

1260
01:10:50,825 --> 01:10:53,653
Johnny, please get some more glasses.

1261
01:10:53,653 --> 01:10:56,116
They can’t see the water. 
They’re blind.

1262
01:10:56,116 --> 01:10:57,893
All right, Howard, 
I'm hanging up.

1263
01:10:57,893 --> 01:10:59,935
I thought I was perfectly clear.

1264
01:11:00,232 --> 01:11:03,258
- At 5:30 I am out the door.
- I told you I was coming to you.

1265
01:11:03,258 --> 01:11:06,023
I'm coming to you. I have the stone.
Don't you dare leave.

1266
01:11:06,023 --> 01:11:08,362
- I have a wedding in Newport...
- Howard.

1267
01:11:08,362 --> 01:11:09,474
No!

1268
01:11:09,474 --> 01:11:10,699
Howard.

1269
01:11:10,699 --> 01:11:13,373
Stop. You're being, 
fucking, crazy again. Stop.

1270
01:11:13,451 --> 01:11:15,277
Listen, I got no time to talk.

1271
01:11:15,277 --> 01:11:17,845
I have to be at Adley's in 
50 minutes before they close.

1272
01:11:17,893 --> 01:11:20,288
- I'll go with you. I'll go with you.
- Then I gotta get to my father-in-law.

1273
01:11:20,288 --> 01:11:23,395
Howard, please, I'm really sick.
I don't feel well. I gotta out of bed...

1274
01:11:23,395 --> 01:11:25,809
I see you were in a big rush 
to come over here?

1275
01:11:25,974 --> 01:11:28,142
You got yourself a, fucking, smoothie!

1276
01:11:28,142 --> 01:11:30,793
- I was in a big rush.
- I want you out.

1277
01:11:30,793 --> 01:11:32,235
You motherfucker!

1278
01:11:32,235 --> 01:11:34,375
Get out of the apartment 
by the end of the day.

1279
01:11:34,375 --> 01:11:35,797
Fuck you!

1280
01:11:35,801 --> 01:11:37,208
Out of my life.

1281
01:11:40,779 --> 01:11:42,496
You have no idea.

1282
01:11:59,201 --> 01:12:00,826
- How you're doing, Howie?
- Hey.

1283
01:12:02,307 --> 01:12:03,324
Good Pesach, Howie.

1284
01:12:03,703 --> 01:12:05,943
All right, Larry, you're Jew again, 
welcome back.

1285
01:12:09,046 --> 01:12:11,216
- Have a good Pascha.
- It's all right.

1286
01:12:11,536 --> 01:12:12,908
- Hey, Howard.
- Hey.

1287
01:12:21,610 --> 01:12:26,627
Baruch Atah Adonai Eloheinu Melech Ha
Olam Bore Peri Ha Adama.

1288
01:12:28,353 --> 01:12:30,053
Get the celery.

1289
01:12:42,677 --> 01:12:45,176
You know what kinda suck
schmuck a little bit, overrated?

1290
01:12:45,327 --> 01:12:46,658
Chris Paul.

1291
01:12:46,658 --> 01:12:48,219
Come on, man, 
he's all NBA, man.

1292
01:12:48,219 --> 01:12:50,261
He can't do it alone.

1293
01:12:50,409 --> 01:12:51,255
That's enough!

1294
01:12:51,255 --> 01:12:52,878
You don't know anything.
What are you saying?

1295
01:12:52,878 --> 01:12:55,182
- I'm talking...
- Shut up everybody!

1296
01:12:55,478 --> 01:12:56,240
Please.

1297
01:12:56,240 --> 01:12:58,011
Natalie. You're up.

1298
01:12:58,435 --> 01:13:00,221
Wait, you skipped my dad.

1299
01:13:01,253 --> 01:13:02,670
Where are we?

1300
01:13:02,803 --> 01:13:05,615
Howard, why don't you 
read the plagues?

1301
01:13:09,094 --> 01:13:13,355
Okay. Ma, you take the Hebrew 
and I'll take the English.

1302
01:13:13,505 --> 01:13:15,098
Yes, my dear.

1303
01:13:16,091 --> 01:13:17,528
Here we go.

1304
01:13:17,909 --> 01:13:20,555
- Dam.
- Blood.

1305
01:13:21,067 --> 01:13:23,653
- Tzefardea.
- Frogs.

1306
01:13:24,092 --> 01:13:26,731
- Kinim.
- Lice.

1307
01:13:27,026 --> 01:13:29,874
- Arov.
- Boiled animals.

1308
01:13:30,211 --> 01:13:33,016
- Dever.
- Pestilence.

1309
01:13:33,239 --> 01:13:36,176
- Sh’chin.
- Boils.

1310
01:13:36,176 --> 01:13:39,103
- Barad.
- Hail.

1311
01:13:39,529 --> 01:13:42,075
- Arbeh.
- Locusts.

1312
01:13:42,387 --> 01:13:44,618
- Choshech.
- Darkness.

1313
01:13:45,206 --> 01:13:49,072
- Makat Bechorot.
- Death of the first born.

1314
01:13:49,072 --> 01:13:51,532
Hardcore, back there.

1315
01:13:52,163 --> 01:13:54,163
That can still happen.

1316
01:13:54,789 --> 01:13:57,311
You know, watch yourselves, kids.

1317
01:14:00,084 --> 01:14:03,542
- Hey, Julia, leave me a message...
- Excuse me.

1318
01:14:04,911 --> 01:14:08,389
You send me something like that 
and then you don't pick up your phone?

1319
01:14:09,756 --> 01:14:11,718
Are you, fucking, with me?

1320
01:14:12,948 --> 01:14:15,141
I'm trying to have a nice, 
peaceful dinner

1321
01:14:15,763 --> 01:14:18,126
with my family, which is something 
you won't understand,

1322
01:14:18,126 --> 01:14:19,730
because you don't have one.

1323
01:14:19,730 --> 01:14:21,663
You wanna play mind games with me?

1324
01:14:23,332 --> 01:14:25,409
So, whatever you meant 
by your little link,

1325
01:14:25,536 --> 01:14:29,436
I meant when I said that I want 
you out of my apartment tonight.

1326
01:14:30,591 --> 01:14:34,191
And I want confirmation, 
by text, not a link.

1327
01:14:34,542 --> 01:14:41,034
Via text, "Howie, I am gone, 10 PM".
Don't you, fucking, call me!

1328
01:14:47,789 --> 01:14:50,821
Arno, what the fuck?
Can we just, fucking, talk?

1329
01:14:50,821 --> 01:14:52,413
We're family, we're here, 
right now.

1330
01:14:52,413 --> 01:14:53,777
Out of my way.

1331
01:14:53,777 --> 01:14:56,870
Yeah, not so tough without 
your friends around, are you?

1332
01:14:57,343 --> 01:14:59,677
Are you?

1333
01:15:00,257 --> 01:15:02,053
Fucking pussy!

1334
01:15:02,173 --> 01:15:04,632
- You like, you love this roster?
- I love it.

1335
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:08,436
Baron Davis is done. 
Let's start fresh: Melo, Amare.

1336
01:15:08,436 --> 01:15:09,950
- What about Lin?
- That's it.

1337
01:15:09,950 --> 01:15:10,853
We gotta bring back Lin.

1338
01:15:10,853 --> 01:15:13,453
You know what, fucking, Lin’s 
not coming back next year?

1339
01:15:13,453 --> 01:15:15,679
Cause Dolan saw how everybody 
were so fucking happy,

1340
01:15:15,679 --> 01:15:18,382
- and said "how can I ruin that?".
- Exactly! Howard, fucking, knows.

1341
01:15:18,416 --> 01:15:21,870
You realize that I met my wife 
at the first game that started Linsanity.

1342
01:15:22,018 --> 01:15:23,538
You know what he says to me.

1343
01:15:23,696 --> 01:15:26,576
He comes over to me 
and says "Happy Holidays".

1344
01:15:27,106 --> 01:15:28,884
Like it's Christmas.

1345
01:15:28,975 --> 01:15:31,507
It's like having 
an intruder in your own home.

1346
01:15:32,261 --> 01:15:34,708
He's not bothering anybody, all right?

1347
01:15:34,872 --> 01:15:35,701
He's trying.

1348
01:15:35,701 --> 01:15:38,220
Easy for you to say, 
he didn’t marry your daughter.

1349
01:15:55,584 --> 01:15:57,807
This is, KG, huh?

1350
01:15:57,924 --> 01:16:00,725
Off. Three for eleven?
What the fuck?

1351
01:16:01,229 --> 01:16:02,409
He looks tortured.

1352
01:16:02,409 --> 01:16:05,032
That, fucking, guy tried 
to steal an opal from me.

1353
01:16:05,032 --> 01:16:07,492
- Your opal? Your opal It came?
- The opal came, yeah.

1354
01:16:07,889 --> 01:16:10,534
Stupidly, I lent it
to this motherfucker and he's...

1355
01:16:10,534 --> 01:16:11,979
What do you mean? 
He took it? He stole it?

1356
01:16:11,979 --> 01:16:15,881
He didn't steal it, he got carried away. 
He thinks it has magic powers.

1357
01:16:15,881 --> 01:16:17,837
Magic powers?

1358
01:16:19,128 --> 01:16:21,023
- No, really?
- Look, look at him tonight.

1359
01:16:21,023 --> 01:16:23,914
Without it, he didn't have it tonight, 
look how fucking bad he played.

1360
01:16:24,281 --> 01:16:25,730
He wants to own it.

1361
01:16:25,730 --> 01:16:29,811
So, I told him to come to the auction 
and, fucking, make a bid for it like everyone else.

1362
01:16:29,868 --> 01:16:32,005
- When is this auction?
- The auction is Monday.

1363
01:16:33,303 --> 01:16:35,330
Okay, so what do you think it's worth?

1364
01:16:35,569 --> 01:16:40,571
Well, listen, it's anywhere from 
a thousand to 3 thousand dollars a carat.

1365
01:16:40,612 --> 01:16:42,235
And it's 6 hundred carats.

1366
01:16:42,381 --> 01:16:45,946
That's over a million dollars.
He's very rich.

1367
01:16:46,170 --> 01:16:48,828
Not as rich as Gooey! 
But I’m working on it.

1368
01:16:49,574 --> 01:16:52,192
Who’s comparing? Rich is rich.

1369
01:16:52,192 --> 01:16:56,773
I made a crazy risk at a gamble 
and, it's about to pay off.

1370
01:17:02,925 --> 01:17:05,539
Don't look at us, 
don't look at him, don't look at me.

1371
01:17:05,539 --> 01:17:07,321
Find it yourself.

1372
01:17:07,467 --> 01:17:09,105
Come on, keep looking.

1373
01:17:09,105 --> 01:17:10,548
That's warm, warm, warm.

1374
01:17:10,687 --> 01:17:12,142
Warmer.

1375
01:17:12,833 --> 01:17:14,176
Very warm.

1376
01:17:14,176 --> 01:17:16,338
Keep looking.

1377
01:17:16,821 --> 01:17:19,107
I found it!

1378
01:17:19,304 --> 01:17:20,986
That's my boy!

1379
01:17:25,374 --> 01:17:27,808
Find your stuff, we're leaving soon.

1380
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:31,692
Let's show them.

1381
01:17:31,782 --> 01:17:35,404
Dad, look, this is Mom's 
Bar mitzvah dress, it still fits her.

1382
01:17:35,619 --> 01:17:37,511
Oh. That’s hysterical.

1383
01:17:38,995 --> 01:17:41,344
It’s 9 o'clock, what do you think, 
we should get going?

1384
01:17:41,344 --> 01:17:43,843
- Yeah let's go, tell the boys.
- I told them.

1385
01:17:48,492 --> 01:17:50,305
What?

1386
01:17:50,917 --> 01:17:53,248
- You look gorgeous.
- Oh God!

1387
01:17:55,205 --> 01:17:58,295
I wanted to talk to you for a minute.

1388
01:17:59,138 --> 01:18:02,431
Just sit down, and, 
we don't have to do it here.

1389
01:18:02,618 --> 01:18:04,899
We'll wait, but I...

1390
01:18:06,014 --> 01:18:08,651
I'm having very serious 
second thoughts.

1391
01:18:12,242 --> 01:18:16,571
We're all together right now.
We're all so comfortable, excited.

1392
01:18:17,058 --> 01:18:19,707
Is it too late? Should we maybe...

1393
01:18:20,647 --> 01:18:22,781
What do you think?
Am I crazy?

1394
01:18:22,932 --> 01:18:24,257
Are you serious right now?

1395
01:18:24,525 --> 01:18:26,607
Yeah, I know, 
I know I fucked up.

1396
01:18:26,832 --> 01:18:28,791
Yeah, you fucked up.
You are a fuckup.

1397
01:18:28,791 --> 01:18:30,481
And I'm not having 
this conversation.

1398
01:18:30,508 --> 01:18:35,084
Please, stop, just stop for one second
and just look at me, look at my eyes.

1399
01:18:35,119 --> 01:18:37,208
And they'll tell you what I'm feeling.

1400
01:18:37,208 --> 01:18:39,351
Please?

1401
01:18:50,931 --> 01:18:53,879
What?
What are you thinking?

1402
01:18:54,603 --> 01:18:57,436
What? Tell me.
I wanna know.

1403
01:18:57,823 --> 01:18:59,948
I know. What?

1404
01:18:59,948 --> 01:19:03,403
Your face is so stupid.

1405
01:19:04,530 --> 01:19:07,239
- Okay.
- Oh my God.

1406
01:19:07,239 --> 01:19:10,440
I'm gonna leave her.
I'll leave her. I don't need her.

1407
01:19:10,909 --> 01:19:12,667
We're done.

1408
01:19:12,667 --> 01:19:13,518
- Okay.
- It's done.

1409
01:19:13,518 --> 01:19:15,874
It was stupid. She's trash.

1410
01:19:16,804 --> 01:19:18,804
She's trash. I know that.

1411
01:19:19,907 --> 01:19:23,469
It was stupid. I'm done.
I'm done. It means nothing.

1412
01:19:23,469 --> 01:19:24,850
It meant nothing.

1413
01:19:24,850 --> 01:19:29,144
Please. I'm begging, you just
give me another shot.

1414
01:19:32,150 --> 01:19:33,673
You know what, Howard?

1415
01:19:33,673 --> 01:19:35,684
Say yes, what?

1416
01:19:35,684 --> 01:19:39,235
I think you are the most 
annoying person I've ever met.

1417
01:19:39,588 --> 01:19:42,078
I hate being with you. 
I hate looking at you.

1418
01:19:42,513 --> 01:19:46,001
And if I had my way, 
I would never see you again.

1419
01:19:47,088 --> 01:19:49,988
That's 'cause you're mad.
You're mad and it makes sense.

1420
01:19:51,332 --> 01:19:54,208
- You can punch me if you want.
- Oh, thanks.

1421
01:19:58,653 --> 01:20:00,157
I don't even want to touch you.

1422
01:20:00,157 --> 01:20:02,712
Oh my God!
Are you kidding me?

1423
01:20:02,712 --> 01:20:03,545
Wait. Turn around.
I wanna see.

1424
01:20:03,545 --> 01:20:05,446
- Did you see that?
- Oh my God!

1425
01:20:05,446 --> 01:20:08,214
I hate you!
That's how fit you're right now?

1426
01:20:08,319 --> 01:20:10,478
I was fifteen pounds overweight!

1427
01:20:10,793 --> 01:20:13,743
I'll get the car, okay?
I'll get the car.

1428
01:20:24,135 --> 01:20:25,696
She's always...

1429
01:20:25,861 --> 01:20:29,060
Like we wanna see everything 
she's doing at every moment.

1430
01:20:29,952 --> 01:20:32,593
- You think she's jealous of me?
- Yeah, she wants your life.

1431
01:20:33,095 --> 01:20:35,616
- She wants our house.
- And she can have it.

1432
01:20:36,946 --> 01:20:38,652
Why are you taking Lex?

1433
01:20:38,652 --> 01:20:41,092
We'll take the tunnel, 
it’s better, less traffic.

1434
01:20:42,725 --> 01:20:46,654
Plus, I wanna grab something from 
the apartment, and it’s right there.

1435
01:20:53,254 --> 01:20:55,449
We gonna stop 
by the apartment, guys.

1436
01:20:55,449 --> 01:20:57,558
Oh my God.

1437
01:20:57,894 --> 01:21:01,413
- Daddy's got thinks to do.
- Oh, it's so annoying.

1438
01:21:01,791 --> 01:21:03,397
That business.

1439
01:21:14,856 --> 01:21:17,031
- Hi, Mr. Ratner, how are you?
- How are you?

1440
01:21:17,067 --> 01:21:19,132
- Anything in the trunk?
- I’m just gonna be up and down.

1441
01:21:19,132 --> 01:21:20,974
- If you need anything let me know.
- I gotta use the bathroom.

1442
01:21:21,367 --> 01:21:23,535
Hold it in, all right?
It's just 25 minutes before we're home.

1443
01:21:23,535 --> 01:21:24,573
- I can't wait that long.
- Don't be ridiculous.

1444
01:21:24,573 --> 01:21:25,678
Eddie go upstairs 
and use the bathroom.

1445
01:21:25,678 --> 01:21:29,061
I'm tired, I wanna go to sleep.
You couldn't go at Grandpa's.

1446
01:21:29,061 --> 01:21:30,813
You had to wait till now?

1447
01:21:31,232 --> 01:21:33,709
Come on, we're going.
We're going.

1448
01:21:34,641 --> 01:21:36,188
Goddamnit.

1449
01:21:37,728 --> 01:21:40,090
Bathroom’s all fucked up 
because of construction,

1450
01:21:40,090 --> 01:21:42,404
so, I’m gonna ask a neighbor.

1451
01:21:42,499 --> 01:21:44,469
Dad, I don't wanna use a 
neighbor's bathroom, I'm taking a shit.

1452
01:21:44,469 --> 01:21:46,322
Have you ever seen 
the show Good Times?

1453
01:21:46,322 --> 01:21:46,941
No.

1454
01:21:46,941 --> 01:21:49,812
You, actually, gonna like this.
This guy was the father on the show.

1455
01:21:49,856 --> 01:21:52,533
- What? I don't care.
- I showed it to you.

1456
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:56,741
He was in Coming to America.

1457
01:21:56,916 --> 01:21:59,183
He’s probably sleeping,
I bet he's an old man.

1458
01:21:59,445 --> 01:22:01,836
- Who is it?
- It's Howard, next door.

1459
01:22:01,924 --> 01:22:03,716
I live in E.

1460
01:22:06,437 --> 01:22:07,925
Hey, how are you?

1461
01:22:07,925 --> 01:22:08,762
What's up?

1462
01:22:08,762 --> 01:22:10,535
Unfortunately, my bathroom 
is all fucked up.

1463
01:22:10,535 --> 01:22:13,669
And this kid's gotta go. 
Can we use yours for a minute?

1464
01:22:14,123 --> 01:22:15,756
No, sorry.

1465
01:22:16,567 --> 01:22:19,104
- What a, fucking, dickhead!
- Hey, stop that.

1466
01:22:19,104 --> 01:22:20,646
He's a, fucking, legend.

1467
01:22:22,672 --> 01:22:26,382
- Hello?
- Hi, I'm your neighbor.

1468
01:22:26,711 --> 01:22:28,220
- Hey, how you doing?
- How are you?

1469
01:22:28,220 --> 01:22:30,456
- I'm your neighbor, I never introduced myself.
- Allen, how are you?

1470
01:22:30,456 --> 01:22:32,977
My bathroom is all fucked up 
and my son needs to use.

1471
01:22:32,977 --> 01:22:34,817
Can he use yours for a second?

1472
01:22:35,129 --> 01:22:36,500
Is it number one, 
or number two?

1473
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:38,300
- One.
- He's gonna go one.

1474
01:22:38,605 --> 01:22:40,814
All right? So, you go quick.
All right, on the back.

1475
01:22:40,814 --> 01:22:42,793
I'll meet you in the hallway.

1476
01:22:58,009 --> 01:22:59,393
Julia?

1477
01:23:12,362 --> 01:23:16,444
Have a nice life, I hope you find 
everything you're looking for.

1478
01:23:54,549 --> 01:23:56,136
Yeah, I'm coming.

1479
01:24:02,587 --> 01:24:03,978
Yeah.

1480
01:24:09,606 --> 01:24:11,398
Come on, let's go.

1481
01:24:22,226 --> 01:24:24,043
Who's the girl, 
living in your apartment?

1482
01:24:25,176 --> 01:24:26,079
What did you say?

1483
01:24:26,079 --> 01:24:28,521
Yeah, that guy told me there’s some 
hot chick living in your apartment.

1484
01:24:28,521 --> 01:24:29,585
Who is that, mom?

1485
01:24:29,585 --> 01:24:31,237
What were you doing, 
talking to that coke-head?

1486
01:24:31,237 --> 01:24:33,343
- He was talking to me.
- I told you to go in there and take a shit!

1487
01:24:33,343 --> 01:24:35,402
- I did take a shit.
- That was it. Get on the elevator.

1488
01:24:35,402 --> 01:24:36,695
It’s enough already!

1489
01:24:39,773 --> 01:24:42,107
Don't talk about that to anybody.

1490
01:24:58,953 --> 01:25:01,216
- Did you get what you needed?
- Yeah.

1491
01:25:28,576 --> 01:25:31,342
Put the recycling in the garbage, 
before you come in the house.

1492
01:26:34,270 --> 01:26:35,929
Big day.

1493
01:26:37,252 --> 01:26:40,058
Magnolia bakery, 
from the downtown original.

1494
01:26:40,289 --> 01:26:42,390
- Thank you.
- Did you have these? Delicious.

1495
01:26:42,834 --> 01:26:45,758
You tell everybody here thank you so much
and they are welcome.

1496
01:26:45,758 --> 01:26:48,102
- Will do.
- And these are on me, Howard Ratner.

1497
01:26:48,549 --> 01:26:51,565
What's this? 
This is the catalog for today?

1498
01:26:51,565 --> 01:26:53,139
That's the one.

1499
01:26:56,824 --> 01:26:58,901
- Stops right on me.
- Thank you.

1500
01:27:03,450 --> 01:27:06,303
What, the fuck, is this?
This is a mistake.

1501
01:27:06,446 --> 01:27:08,199
- That's a correction.
- No.

1502
01:27:08,199 --> 01:27:10,344
It's a correction, 
but it's a, fucking, mistake.

1503
01:27:10,344 --> 01:27:11,994
Where is Anne, 
I wanna speak with here.

1504
01:27:11,994 --> 01:27:13,578
I'm sorry, Anne is in 
a meeting right now.

1505
01:27:13,578 --> 01:27:17,155
No, get her out of the meeting.
It's an emergency, I wanna speak with her.

1506
01:27:17,941 --> 01:27:21,128
Call her on the phone, please.
Thank you.

1507
01:27:22,729 --> 01:27:25,182
If you promise 
to keep your voice down.

1508
01:27:25,182 --> 01:27:26,755
- Yes.
- I'm happy to call her.

1509
01:27:26,755 --> 01:27:29,127
Jesus, fucking, Christ!

1510
01:27:30,641 --> 01:27:31,582
Hello, Anne.

1511
01:27:31,582 --> 01:27:34,836
Can you ask how this 
155 bullshit happened?

1512
01:27:35,052 --> 01:27:36,436
Did you hear that?

1513
01:27:37,547 --> 01:27:39,919
- Okay.
- What did she say?

1514
01:27:40,872 --> 01:27:42,228
I'm afraid that's your appraisal.

1515
01:27:42,228 --> 01:27:45,853
I know that's what it says, 
I'm asking who came up with the, fucking, figure.

1516
01:27:46,139 --> 01:27:48,831
- Oscar in Gems.
- Oscar is, fucking, wrong.

1517
01:27:48,979 --> 01:27:51,985
I can go on and get 
6 appraisers right now,

1518
01:27:51,985 --> 01:27:54,917
5 of them would say 
at least three thousand dollars a carat.

1519
01:27:54,917 --> 01:27:57,215
- He is saying he can go to 6 appraisers...
- Give me the phone.

1520
01:27:57,215 --> 01:27:59,656
Can I speak with her please?

1521
01:27:59,796 --> 01:28:01,446
Look, I'm sorry, 
but I have to hand you over.

1522
01:28:01,446 --> 01:28:03,423
No, that wouldn't be necessarily,
I'd rather you didn't.

1523
01:28:03,622 --> 01:28:04,835
- Anne.
- Yes.

1524
01:28:04,835 --> 01:28:06,431
This is, fucking, outrageous.

1525
01:28:06,431 --> 01:28:08,562
Okay, you need to 
calm yourself down, Mr. Ratner.

1526
01:28:08,562 --> 01:28:12,514
I don't wanna be calm.
This appraisal is a, fucking, joke.

1527
01:28:12,514 --> 01:28:15,249
Oscar happens to be one of our most 
experienced gemologists.

1528
01:28:15,249 --> 01:28:17,728
Who, clearly, knows 
nothing about colored stones.

1529
01:28:17,728 --> 01:28:19,734
And why, the fuck, 
am I hearing about it now?

1530
01:28:19,734 --> 01:28:24,911
Do I need to remind you that you brought the opal to us
on a Friday night for an auction set on a Monday morning?

1531
01:28:24,911 --> 01:28:27,785
- We were lucky to get appraised at all...
- I don't give a fuck. I don't care.

1532
01:28:27,785 --> 01:28:29,065
It needs to be changed. Do it.

1533
01:28:29,201 --> 01:28:31,288
That's not an option, but...
If you like we can pull it.

1534
01:28:31,288 --> 01:28:34,259
Pull it? No, no.
We are not gonna pull it.

1535
01:28:34,259 --> 01:28:35,718
Here's what you'll do.

1536
01:28:35,718 --> 01:28:38,811
You gonna make an announcement 
at the top of the auction.

1537
01:28:38,958 --> 01:28:40,422
That the correction was wrong.

1538
01:28:40,422 --> 01:28:42,401
- No, no.
- And the original estimate stands.

1539
01:28:42,401 --> 01:28:46,656
We are not correcting a correction!
We can either pull it or carry on as is.

1540
01:28:46,656 --> 01:28:48,660
- It's entirely up to you.
- Okay, thank you so much.

1541
01:28:48,660 --> 01:28:51,059
- Okay, Anne, I'm sorry too.
- You know I have been...

1542
01:28:51,191 --> 01:28:53,590
- We are done here, I had enough of this.
- Yes, that would be perfect, I'll let her know.

1543
01:28:53,590 --> 01:28:56,606
Let who know? Me and my stuff 
had to work the entire weekend...

1544
01:28:56,606 --> 01:29:01,240
Okay, thank you so much Anne and I wanna say 
from the bottom of my heart, I apologise.

1545
01:29:01,240 --> 01:29:02,858
- Okay, I'll tell her, thank you.
- You understand?

1546
01:29:02,858 --> 01:29:04,124
I can assure you, this is the last...

1547
01:29:04,124 --> 01:29:09,955
So, she said that we need to take the 
inserts out of each catalog

1548
01:29:10,333 --> 01:29:14,268
before the auction starts, 
so, you have those.

1549
01:29:14,268 --> 01:29:17,703
If you want, I saw box down there,
and I can start on these.

1550
01:29:21,749 --> 01:29:24,488
- What is that? What are you doing?
- I just have a question for Anne.

1551
01:29:24,488 --> 01:29:26,219
You don't need to call her.
I just spoke with her.

1552
01:29:26,219 --> 01:29:28,019
Oh, it's a simple question, 
don't worry about it.

1553
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:28,794
Howard.

1554
01:29:28,794 --> 01:29:30,899
Hi, Anne, he's saying 
that you told him to...

1555
01:29:30,899 --> 01:29:34,119
Okay, listen, just, fucking, put them 
back in, I don't give a shit.

1556
01:29:34,119 --> 01:29:35,808
- Gooey!
- We're here.

1557
01:29:35,808 --> 01:29:37,834
You're sight for sore eyes.

1558
01:29:37,834 --> 01:29:39,149
Is he here?

1559
01:29:39,149 --> 01:29:41,858
KG? He is...
I didn't see him yet.

1560
01:29:41,967 --> 01:29:44,589
Is he there?
I got all these things for him to sign.

1561
01:29:44,589 --> 01:29:46,621
Listen to me, listen.
Do you want them?

1562
01:29:46,621 --> 01:29:51,160
Get that before the auction starts.
Go to the auction, see if he's there.

1563
01:29:51,160 --> 01:29:53,617
- He's a great guy, you'll love him.
- He's excited.

1564
01:29:53,852 --> 01:29:55,876
I wanna ask you a little favor.

1565
01:29:56,495 --> 01:29:57,987
What, what favor?

1566
01:29:59,309 --> 01:30:01,427
I need you to jack up the bids.

1567
01:30:02,289 --> 01:30:04,258
What? No, no.
Absolutely not.

1568
01:30:04,408 --> 01:30:07,610
Gooey, a little bit, just here 
and there you make a bid.

1569
01:30:07,610 --> 01:30:10,462
I just gotta make sure 
we get it up to 250.

1570
01:30:12,127 --> 01:30:13,429
What if I win at 250?

1571
01:30:13,429 --> 01:30:15,671
That's easy, 
I'll give it right back to you.

1572
01:30:15,671 --> 01:30:17,302
Jesus!

1573
01:30:18,460 --> 01:30:20,576
This is not a really nice position 
you put me in, you know?

1574
01:30:20,576 --> 01:30:22,853
- I reset this. Very much.
- You think I wanna do this?

1575
01:30:22,910 --> 01:30:26,879
I fucked up, I should've got 
my own appraisal, but I didn't have the time.

1576
01:30:27,185 --> 01:30:28,708
How much they appraised it for?

1577
01:30:28,708 --> 01:30:30,425
- 200.
- 200?

1578
01:30:30,425 --> 01:30:33,725
But these assholes, 
they don't have an opal specialist.

1579
01:30:33,776 --> 01:30:39,138
My guy at the AGL says 500, 
just based of the pictures.

1580
01:30:39,288 --> 01:30:43,437
Listen, 20 % I give you for the winning bidding.
You got to be a partner with me.

1581
01:30:43,568 --> 01:30:46,035
KG is gonna buy it.
It's not a problem.

1582
01:30:46,035 --> 01:30:48,146
This guy is obsessed with the stone.

1583
01:30:48,727 --> 01:30:51,422
Today was supposed to be 
about Aaron meeting KG.

1584
01:30:51,904 --> 01:30:53,418
- Gooey.
- To show support.

1585
01:30:53,418 --> 01:30:54,954
That's what today 
was supposed to be about.

1586
01:30:55,138 --> 01:30:57,791
This is support, this is support 
like you've never known.

1587
01:30:58,386 --> 01:31:00,542
Sold to you, thank you so much, sir.

1588
01:31:01,784 --> 01:31:05,548
We move on now, ladies 
and gentlemen, to lot number 38.

1589
01:31:05,711 --> 01:31:09,290
Lot 38, we have a sale room notice.

1590
01:31:09,780 --> 01:31:13,513
I’m required to inform you all 
that this fine Ethiopian black opal,

1591
01:31:13,513 --> 01:31:16,167
presented here before you all, 
your left, my right.

1592
01:31:16,305 --> 01:31:22,857
Is now offered with a revised estimate 
of a 155 to 225 thousand US dollars.

1593
01:31:23,390 --> 01:31:27,195
Ladies and gentlemen, it is a fine piece, 
a collector's work.

1594
01:31:27,344 --> 01:31:30,776
And, most importantly, 
it is windowed on either side,

1595
01:31:30,776 --> 01:31:36,729
to reveal the full spectrum of its dazzling 
color and the pin-fire pattern within.

1596
01:31:37,081 --> 01:31:41,043
So, with that in mind, ladies and gentlemen,
my colleagues are ready and poised on the phones.

1597
01:31:41,043 --> 01:31:42,918
And you all ready with your paddles.

1598
01:31:42,918 --> 01:31:46,153
We shall start the bidding now 
at twenty thousand dollars.

1599
01:31:46,175 --> 01:31:48,236
Twenty thousand now. 
Thirty thousand.

1600
01:31:48,236 --> 01:31:49,706
Do I have forty thousand now?

1601
01:31:49,827 --> 01:31:52,813
Forty thousand, gentleman's bid.
Pleasure to see you, sir, thank you, sir.

1602
01:31:52,813 --> 01:31:55,041
Forty thousand now.
Do I see fifty?

1603
01:31:55,432 --> 01:31:57,619
Fifty thousand now.
A new place, thank you, sir.

1604
01:31:57,619 --> 01:31:59,112
Pleasure to have you back too, sir.

1605
01:31:59,298 --> 01:32:01,952
Fifty thousand now against you, sir.
Should we say sixty?

1606
01:32:01,952 --> 01:32:05,308
Sixty thousand now against you, sir.
Seventy thousand now against you, sir.

1607
01:32:05,720 --> 01:32:06,899
One hundred grand.

1608
01:32:06,899 --> 01:32:10,137
One hundred thousand now!
Bid with you, sir.

1609
01:32:10,137 --> 01:32:12,782
And a great place. 
A big, bold, giant leap

1610
01:32:12,901 --> 01:32:15,933
for a big, bold, giant leaper at 
a hundred thousand dollars.

1611
01:32:16,015 --> 01:32:18,257
No longer yours, sir.
It's against you, sir.

1612
01:32:18,287 --> 01:32:21,642
I'm gonna try one more, sir.
I'll even break an increment for you, sir.

1613
01:32:21,802 --> 01:32:24,578
Can I ask you to consider 
a bid of 105 thousand, sir?

1614
01:32:24,966 --> 01:32:26,505
Come on, sir. You sure?

1615
01:32:27,072 --> 01:32:28,824
Positive? No farther?

1616
01:32:28,999 --> 01:32:30,597
A defiant nod, then?

1617
01:32:30,901 --> 01:32:34,316
Looking then for a 110 in the room.
It's a hundred thousand now.

1618
01:32:34,945 --> 01:32:36,092
Is there any farther bidding?

1619
01:32:36,092 --> 01:32:38,597
110 thousand now.
Welcome back, sir.

1620
01:32:38,762 --> 01:32:40,804
110 thousand now.
Once again against you, sir.

1621
01:32:40,804 --> 01:32:42,993
Should we try 120?
120 now.

1622
01:32:43,549 --> 01:32:45,714
Try one more, sir.
Just try 130.

1623
01:32:45,714 --> 01:32:46,747
130 now.

1624
01:32:46,747 --> 01:32:49,720
Should we try 140?
140 thousand now.

1625
01:32:49,720 --> 01:32:52,159
Come on, sir, it's up again, to 150.

1626
01:32:52,462 --> 01:32:55,564
Try one more at a 150 thousand.
No longer yours, sir.

1627
01:32:55,564 --> 01:32:58,102
Should we try 160?
160 now.

1628
01:32:58,248 --> 01:33:00,149
Back against you again, sir.

1629
01:33:00,149 --> 01:33:03,747
Can we try one more to a 170?
170 now.

1630
01:33:03,869 --> 01:33:06,206
Say 180. Say 180, sir.

1631
01:33:06,380 --> 01:33:07,732
You were okay down 175.

1632
01:33:07,732 --> 01:33:10,003
180 thousand dollar now.

1633
01:33:10,003 --> 01:33:13,553
Bid back against you, sir.
I'm looking for a 190 thousand.

1634
01:33:14,595 --> 01:33:18,636
190 thousand dollars is bid.
Against you, sir.

1635
01:33:18,636 --> 01:33:19,893
You have to bid to this claim.

1636
01:33:20,021 --> 01:33:23,121
A 190 thousand.
Confer with your adviser now.

1637
01:33:25,949 --> 01:33:27,831
- Seriously, we need to go.
- It's okay, I need this though.

1638
01:33:27,918 --> 01:33:29,944
We gonna move this up any higher?
Any farther?

1639
01:33:29,944 --> 01:33:32,998
- Relax, serious?
- It's a last chance for you, sir.

1640
01:33:33,009 --> 01:33:36,205
I have to move this along, 
we have a good bid at a 190 thousand.

1641
01:33:36,597 --> 01:33:38,781
I'm looking for two hundred, sir.

1642
01:33:40,133 --> 01:33:42,943
You gonna move this up any higher?
Any farther?

1643
01:33:45,059 --> 01:33:46,374
You sure, sir?

1644
01:33:46,535 --> 01:33:48,705
- Last chance, fair warning.
- Let's go.

1645
01:33:48,987 --> 01:33:53,136
So, with you, sir, at a 190 
thousand dollars against the phones.

1646
01:33:53,235 --> 01:33:54,881
Against the rest of the room.

1647
01:33:55,578 --> 01:33:58,448
Sold to you, sir, 
at a 190 thousand dollars.

1648
01:33:59,513 --> 01:34:01,560
Thank you so much.
Thank you, sir.

1649
01:34:01,560 --> 01:34:03,752
Panel 172.

1650
01:34:11,196 --> 01:34:13,571
Gooey, I'm so, goddamn, sorry.

1651
01:34:14,695 --> 01:34:15,996
Thank you very much.

1652
01:34:16,384 --> 01:34:18,948
I'm sorry. Listen, I...

1653
01:34:19,906 --> 01:34:22,181
Oh, this is 49th street. 
Supposed to be on 48th street.

1654
01:34:22,181 --> 01:34:23,421
Thank you.

1655
01:34:23,680 --> 01:34:27,235
- That's a 190 grand, Howard.
- Yes, that's temporarily.

1656
01:34:28,753 --> 01:34:32,212
I'm sorry.
I gotta tell you I was gonna stop...

1657
01:34:32,212 --> 01:34:34,454
Didn't I tell you that 
was gonna happen, Howard?

1658
01:34:34,454 --> 01:34:35,821
- I'm sorry.
- So now what?

1659
01:34:36,216 --> 01:34:39,995
So, your money gonna go into my account, 
I'll wire it right back to you.

1660
01:34:39,995 --> 01:34:42,951
- Including Adley’s 20%?
- Absolutely, that comes right out of my pocket.

1661
01:34:42,951 --> 01:34:45,382
- That is nearly 38 grand, Howard.
- I know that.

1662
01:34:45,940 --> 01:34:48,596
So, I'm gonna need a couple 
of weeks on that. But it will be done.

1663
01:34:48,596 --> 01:34:49,813
- I promise you.
- All right.

1664
01:34:49,948 --> 01:34:52,571
- Aaron, let's go, come on!
- Dad, I got, like, 6 autographs.

1665
01:34:52,571 --> 01:34:53,710
Now!

1666
01:34:55,296 --> 01:34:56,842
You got the autographs, that's great.

1667
01:34:56,842 --> 01:34:57,861
Yeah.

1668
01:34:58,808 --> 01:35:00,231
Wasn't guy like a champ?

1669
01:35:01,515 --> 01:35:03,247
- Don't be mad at me, please.
- Get in.

1670
01:35:03,247 --> 01:35:04,625
Please don't be mad.

1671
01:35:05,962 --> 01:35:08,435
Come on, can I get the opal?
Let me get the opal.

1672
01:35:08,435 --> 01:35:10,915
- What for? 
- Because I gotta sell that.

1673
01:35:10,915 --> 01:35:13,140
- Take the fucking opal.
- Yes, all right, okay, thanks.

1674
01:35:14,054 --> 01:35:16,193
Get them going.
Open the fucking door.

1675
01:35:16,555 --> 01:35:18,154
What's he waiting for you for?

1676
01:35:20,224 --> 01:35:21,308
All right.

1677
01:35:23,611 --> 01:35:25,241
I know.

1678
01:35:25,812 --> 01:35:27,694
Let them go
and then we'll talk.

1679
01:35:28,364 --> 01:35:30,642
- What the fuck was that?
- All right, I fucked up.

1680
01:35:30,719 --> 01:35:34,289
It was a mistake, all right?
I know, I admit it. I gotta...

1681
01:35:35,373 --> 01:35:37,864
Just hit pause for one, 
fucking, second.

1682
01:35:37,864 --> 01:35:42,057
Gotta call Kevin, 'cause I know 
he, fucking, wants it, you saw.

1683
01:35:42,490 --> 01:35:47,734
He's got the 175 and then 
everything will be copacetic, all right?

1684
01:35:48,641 --> 01:35:51,560
KG, it's me. 
I got great news for you.

1685
01:35:52,950 --> 01:35:55,929
Hello?

1686
01:35:56,414 --> 01:35:58,003
No one on the, fucking, phone!

1687
01:35:59,460 --> 01:36:02,514
- If you just give me two, fucking...
- Get, the fuck, out.

1688
01:36:02,927 --> 01:36:04,577
You're lucky there are 
people around you, you prick.

1689
01:36:04,577 --> 01:36:06,010
Come on, get out of here.
Let's go.

1690
01:36:06,010 --> 01:36:07,772
Hey, fucking...

1691
01:36:22,591 --> 01:36:24,574
Arno.

1692
01:36:24,755 --> 01:36:27,070
Just listen to me, please.
I spoke...

1693
01:36:27,675 --> 01:36:30,166
I spoke to Demany,
remember Demany?

1694
01:36:30,166 --> 01:36:33,079
He's a business friend of mine.
He gave me the, fucking...

1695
01:36:33,079 --> 01:36:35,476
That's enough, Howard!
That's fucking enough!

1696
01:36:36,014 --> 01:36:37,953
Why are you being 
so thickheaded?

1697
01:36:39,318 --> 01:36:42,304
Fuck you man, suck my dick!
Throw him in the, fucking, water!

1698
01:36:58,043 --> 01:36:59,878
Where, the fuck, are my glasses?

1699
01:37:42,310 --> 01:37:46,812
I know this is a 400 dollar bag.
I'll give you 250.

1700
01:37:46,812 --> 01:37:49,592
- Howard.
- Forget about Howard...

1701
01:38:18,117 --> 01:38:20,167
- Howard, Justin is...
- I'm not feeling good.

1702
01:38:20,167 --> 01:38:22,385
- Are you okay, what wrong with you?
- I won't work.

1703
01:38:22,629 --> 01:38:24,746
- Send everybody home.
- All right, sweetie.

1704
01:39:05,841 --> 01:39:08,000
Hey, sorry to bother you.

1705
01:39:08,149 --> 01:39:09,240
What is it?

1706
01:39:09,880 --> 01:39:11,622
I just wanted to see 
how the auction went.

1707
01:39:11,795 --> 01:39:14,899
Terrible, I don't wanna talk about it.

1708
01:39:15,345 --> 01:39:19,685
Okay. Well, Damien and Joseph 
brought this amazing sweat suit,

1709
01:39:19,685 --> 01:39:22,561
that I think it would look so nice on you.
Do you wanna see it?

1710
01:39:22,561 --> 01:39:24,260
Just leave me alone, please.

1711
01:39:24,995 --> 01:39:26,902
Come on, Howard.

1712
01:39:29,196 --> 01:39:31,821
- Don't look at me.
- Oh my God, Howard.

1713
01:39:32,748 --> 01:39:35,196
- Don't look at me.
- What the fuck happened to you?

1714
01:39:35,196 --> 01:39:36,821
Don't look at me, please.

1715
01:39:41,420 --> 01:39:45,343
I don't know if I'm gonna make it.
I don't know. Everybody is...

1716
01:39:45,542 --> 01:39:48,645
- It's not ever going right.
- I know.

1717
01:39:49,254 --> 01:39:50,799
I'm so sad.

1718
01:39:50,799 --> 01:39:54,305
I'm so fucked up.

1719
01:39:55,010 --> 01:39:57,216
Yeah, I'm really upset too.

1720
01:40:01,182 --> 01:40:05,700
I'm sorry if this has anything to do with me,
but I swear, I really didn't do anything.

1721
01:40:05,700 --> 01:40:10,857
I wish you were nicer to me though.
It was not nice what you did to me.

1722
01:40:11,288 --> 01:40:13,549
I tried, but it's really hard.

1723
01:40:13,549 --> 01:40:15,876
I don't know what to do.

1724
01:40:16,117 --> 01:40:19,520
I don't have any place to go.
I don't have anywhere to get.

1725
01:40:19,871 --> 01:40:21,660
But you do.

1726
01:40:21,839 --> 01:40:26,204
Like, really, Howard?
You're my home, you could come to me.

1727
01:40:27,202 --> 01:40:30,109
I can't make it out.
I can't make it...

1728
01:40:30,109 --> 01:40:31,502
What I am I supposed to do?

1729
01:40:31,743 --> 01:40:36,018
Everything I do is not going right.

1730
01:40:36,108 --> 01:40:39,229
I don't know what to do.
I, really, don't know anymore.

1731
01:40:39,229 --> 01:40:40,995
Shit, I really don't...

1732
01:40:40,995 --> 01:40:43,519
I gotta figure this out.

1733
01:40:43,519 --> 01:40:45,102
I really do.

1734
01:40:45,818 --> 01:40:48,901
I got something, if you want.
But you can't make fun of me.

1735
01:40:49,498 --> 01:40:50,664
What?

1736
01:40:52,299 --> 01:40:57,349
It's so stupid. I don't know.
I got it, I thought it would make you feel better.

1737
01:40:57,715 --> 01:40:59,750
Look, unzip my skirt.

1738
01:41:02,044 --> 01:41:04,357
Not like that, 
just unzip my skirt.

1739
01:41:08,329 --> 01:41:09,264
It says "Howie".

1740
01:41:09,264 --> 01:41:11,817
What did you do?
Why would you do that?

1741
01:41:11,817 --> 01:41:13,142
You don't like it?

1742
01:41:13,142 --> 01:41:16,217
- I do, I'm not worth it.
- Yes, you are.

1743
01:41:16,217 --> 01:41:18,003
- I'm not worth it.
- You are worth it.

1744
01:41:18,003 --> 01:41:20,787
- Look. Howie, I'm so crazy about you.
- I don't deserve this.

1745
01:41:20,787 --> 01:41:22,903
Yes, you do. I love you.

1746
01:41:24,186 --> 01:41:27,378
- You can't even get buried with me now.
- It's okay.

1747
01:41:31,453 --> 01:41:33,499
Oh, this, fucking, guy!

1748
01:41:34,130 --> 01:41:36,533
Do not let him in,
understand me?

1749
01:41:36,713 --> 01:41:38,913
Just ignore him.
Ignore him, Joey.

1750
01:41:44,013 --> 01:41:45,555
Here, let's get you cleaned.

1751
01:41:46,506 --> 01:41:49,157
It's not broken, right?
You don't think it's broken, right?

1752
01:41:51,001 --> 01:41:54,458
This is crazy, you can't be 
out here, looking like this.

1753
01:42:01,080 --> 01:42:02,445
Help me answer that.

1754
01:42:02,993 --> 01:42:03,762
Hello.

1755
01:42:03,762 --> 01:42:07,615
Hi, this is Liz, I work with Kevin.
I'm actually, looking for a Howard.

1756
01:42:07,757 --> 01:42:09,232
This is Howard.

1757
01:42:09,232 --> 01:42:12,470
Hi, yes, I got your message 
from Demany about the gem.

1758
01:42:12,621 --> 01:42:14,016
We're at the bank right now.

1759
01:42:16,438 --> 01:42:19,747
- Does he want it?
- Yes, Kevin still interested.

1760
01:42:19,747 --> 01:42:20,690
We can actually...

1761
01:42:20,690 --> 01:42:25,981
It's like we discussed, right?
It's still 175, right?

1762
01:42:25,981 --> 01:42:27,971
- In cash.
- Yes, yes in cash.

1763
01:42:27,971 --> 01:42:29,800
Like I said, 
we're at the bank right now.

1764
01:42:29,800 --> 01:42:31,737
Kevin, yes, I told you.

1765
01:42:31,739 --> 01:42:33,159
- Howard, I gotta go.
- Okay.

1766
01:42:33,293 --> 01:42:34,874
I'll see you soon, goodbye.

1767
01:42:36,672 --> 01:42:38,855
See? I told you.

1768
01:42:39,809 --> 01:42:42,253
Arno. Listen, no bullshit.

1769
01:42:43,207 --> 01:42:45,943
Kevin Garnett is coming 
to my office right now,

1770
01:42:45,943 --> 01:42:49,178
with a 175 thousand dollars 
cash, all right?

1771
01:42:49,583 --> 01:42:53,312
You said I got till Monday?
Today is still Monday.

1772
01:42:53,566 --> 01:42:56,638
I don't know if you're hearing this,
but, Arno, this is real.

1773
01:42:56,638 --> 01:42:59,845
Kevin's really on the way, 
he was just at the bank.

1774
01:42:59,845 --> 01:43:01,343
Come get your money, buddy.

1775
01:43:01,623 --> 01:43:02,929
I need the Celtic ring back.

1776
01:43:02,929 --> 01:43:04,717
- What happened to Friday?
- I know, I know.

1777
01:43:04,717 --> 01:43:06,796
- It's Monday, Howie.
- I know what we said.

1778
01:43:07,149 --> 01:43:10,047
- It was a short week, Pesach...
- What happened to your face?

1779
01:43:10,239 --> 01:43:12,487
Car accident, okay?

1780
01:43:12,877 --> 01:43:13,999
- So listen to me.
- What do you need?

1781
01:43:13,999 --> 01:43:17,309
I need the Celtic ring.
I'm gonna give you the Knicks ring.

1782
01:43:18,097 --> 01:43:20,730
You know what that means 
to me, swap them out, please.

1783
01:43:20,906 --> 01:43:22,314
You've had this Knicks ring forever.

1784
01:43:22,314 --> 01:43:24,369
I just need the Celtic ring back.

1785
01:43:24,905 --> 01:43:26,777
- No, No.
- What do you wanna do?

1786
01:43:27,268 --> 01:43:29,270
- I own that ring right now.
- I know, I know you do.

1787
01:43:30,004 --> 01:43:33,825
I'll swap you the 2 rings, 
but I'm gonna put a 15% vig on this one.

1788
01:43:34,030 --> 01:43:36,751
And if you're not here by Friday, 
it's gonna be the same thing all over again.

1789
01:43:36,751 --> 01:43:38,662
- You're not gonna have a third ring.
- You don't have to worry about it.

1790
01:43:38,729 --> 01:43:41,571
I'll make it 16%, 
I'm sorry I fucked you up.

1791
01:43:41,571 --> 01:43:43,312
Howie, what's going on? 
Are you okay?

1792
01:43:43,312 --> 01:43:45,483
I'm very good. 
Everything's going good.

1793
01:43:45,862 --> 01:43:47,641
I promise you.

1794
01:43:53,263 --> 01:43:58,025
Hey, there he is!
KG, don't you got a game tonight?

1795
01:43:59,011 --> 01:44:01,884
I got your chip right here.
Game night.

1796
01:44:02,075 --> 01:44:03,613
- We really gotta go.
- You must be Liz.

1797
01:44:03,613 --> 01:44:06,199
Yeah, we gonna make it 
quick, absolutely.

1798
01:44:07,224 --> 01:44:10,250
Julia, let's get 
these guys some Powerades.

1799
01:44:10,421 --> 01:44:12,861
Powerades? Water? Anything else?

1800
01:44:13,203 --> 01:44:15,144
It's fine. I'm okay.
That's okay. Yeah, I'm good.

1801
01:44:15,940 --> 01:44:17,850
Howard, let me get a 
second with you, okay?

1802
01:44:19,293 --> 01:44:21,808
Kevin, we need to be in Boston, 
no more than 5 minutes.

1803
01:44:21,808 --> 01:44:23,040
Give me 2 seconds.

1804
01:44:23,322 --> 01:44:24,965
Kevin, we gotta be in Boston 
in less than an hour.

1805
01:44:24,965 --> 01:44:27,045
What's up with you man?
What the fuck is going on?

1806
01:44:27,179 --> 01:44:30,246
Ever since I met you, you've been giving 
me the rid around with everything.

1807
01:44:30,246 --> 01:44:31,066
What do you mean?

1808
01:44:31,066 --> 01:44:34,564
I feel like, you're, fucking, with my emotions,
you're just playing with me at some point.

1809
01:44:34,564 --> 01:44:36,539
This hasn't been straight 
since I came here.

1810
01:44:36,589 --> 01:44:38,656
- You understand?
- Why are you saying that?

1811
01:44:38,807 --> 01:44:40,994
Just one thing, you know, 
I came back over here, I brought it back.

1812
01:44:40,994 --> 01:44:43,630
Howard, I brought it back, 
I didn't have to bring it back, you understand?

1813
01:44:43,630 --> 01:44:45,825
I showed up at the auction, 
you had somebody to bid against me.

1814
01:44:45,825 --> 01:44:48,537
All these, fucking, games, like, 
what, the fuck, are you doing man?

1815
01:44:48,537 --> 01:44:51,256
Like, you don't think I noticed?
You think I know none of this?

1816
01:44:51,262 --> 01:44:54,432
It's complicated, KG.
You see this face?

1817
01:44:54,614 --> 01:44:55,760
Do you see it?

1818
01:44:55,760 --> 01:44:58,033
Here's the 165 thousand 
right there, cash.

1819
01:44:58,033 --> 01:45:00,172
I'm showing you, 
because this wasn't easy.

1820
01:45:00,172 --> 01:45:02,728
Six percent goes to Demany. 
I’ve already taken that out.

1821
01:45:03,118 --> 01:45:04,225
I guess that's fair.

1822
01:45:04,225 --> 01:45:06,473
Let me get the fucking opal, man.
Let me get the fuck out of here.

1823
01:45:06,531 --> 01:45:07,534
- This opal. 
- Yeah.

1824
01:45:07,534 --> 01:45:09,517
- This opal is very valuable for you.
- Absolutely.

1825
01:45:09,517 --> 01:45:10,903
Okay, I did that.

1826
01:45:12,680 --> 01:45:15,795
I respect you.
I respect your passion.

1827
01:45:15,795 --> 01:45:18,430
- Okay, I always had.
- I thought you were a fan too, man.

1828
01:45:18,430 --> 01:45:19,921
I'm a fucking huge fan.

1829
01:45:19,921 --> 01:45:21,344
What did you pay for this?
Real shit.

1830
01:45:21,344 --> 01:45:22,402
What did you pay for this right here?

1831
01:45:22,402 --> 01:45:24,674
That's not a fair question, Kevin.

1832
01:45:25,101 --> 01:45:28,098
We're talking months 
and months of, fucking, my time.

1833
01:45:28,098 --> 01:45:30,303
I'm not gonna take the money back, 
when I did a deal now.

1834
01:45:30,633 --> 01:45:32,763
Straight up. Straight up me and you.
Mono mono.

1835
01:45:33,396 --> 01:45:35,281
How much did you pay for this?

1836
01:45:35,411 --> 01:45:38,097
What did I pay?
I paid... This is...

1837
01:45:39,514 --> 01:45:43,341
I'm telling you, if I answer 
that question it's very misleading.

1838
01:45:43,341 --> 01:45:44,315
Why?

1839
01:45:44,757 --> 01:45:47,617
- I paid a hundred grand.
- So you doubled your money.

1840
01:45:47,735 --> 01:45:50,171
I'm the joker here, all right?
I got fucked.

1841
01:45:50,171 --> 01:45:52,596
A million dollars is what 
I was supposed to get.

1842
01:45:52,887 --> 01:45:56,193
I get a, fucking, what?
Made 65 Gs?

1843
01:45:56,475 --> 01:45:59,585
You gave some niggas, from Ethiopia,
a hundred grand for something,

1844
01:45:59,585 --> 01:46:01,652
you thought was worth 
a million dollars?

1845
01:46:01,652 --> 01:46:02,846
You don't see nothing wrong 
with that, Howard?

1846
01:46:02,846 --> 01:46:05,404
Ethiopian miners, you know what these, 
fucking, guys make?

1847
01:46:05,708 --> 01:46:09,056
A hundred grand is fifty lifetimes 
for these, fucking, guys.

1848
01:46:09,056 --> 01:46:11,290
A million dollars is more, 
that's my point, you understand?

1849
01:46:11,438 --> 01:46:14,864
You wanna win by 1 point 
or, fucking, 30 points, KG?

1850
01:46:15,188 --> 01:46:18,978
Right? I see you out there, 
when the, fucking, stadium's all booing you.

1851
01:46:19,109 --> 01:46:21,586
You're 30 up, you're still going full tilt?

1852
01:46:22,636 --> 01:46:25,390
Let’s see what Vegas...
What is Vegas got you guys at tonight?

1853
01:46:25,489 --> 01:46:26,903
Take a look, let's see.

1854
01:46:26,903 --> 01:46:28,819
Are you serious gonna 
put this up right here?

1855
01:46:28,819 --> 01:46:32,776
Look at this shit, the Sixers are supposed 
to win the game tonight, they think.

1856
01:46:32,848 --> 01:46:34,441
I don't keep a track of none of this shit.
Who give a fuck.

1857
01:46:34,441 --> 01:46:37,698
They think on game 7 
you're not gonna get, fucking, 18 points.

1858
01:46:37,995 --> 01:46:39,880
They don't think 
you gonna get 8 rebounds?

1859
01:46:39,880 --> 01:46:41,072
These guys don't know 
shit about me.

1860
01:46:41,072 --> 01:46:42,338
What, the fuck, do they do?

1861
01:46:42,338 --> 01:46:44,420
Doesn't that make you wanna, 
fucking, kill them?

1862
01:46:44,420 --> 01:46:46,861
Doesn't that make you wanna say 
fuck you for doubting me?

1863
01:46:47,350 --> 01:46:51,256
Doesn't that make you wanna step on, 
fucking, Elton Brand's, fucking, neck?

1864
01:46:52,079 --> 01:46:54,929
Come on, KG, 
this is no different than that.

1865
01:46:55,081 --> 01:46:58,254
This is me, all right?
I'm not a, fucking, athlete.

1866
01:46:58,254 --> 01:47:01,042
This is my, fucking, way.
This is how I win.

1867
01:47:02,010 --> 01:47:04,288
All the, fucking, hard work I do.

1868
01:47:04,288 --> 01:47:07,175
All the, fucking, ass kicking, 
and the dudes I pay.

1869
01:47:07,311 --> 01:47:10,672
You're not gonna score 
on a big one on game 7?

1870
01:47:11,130 --> 01:47:15,013
Fuck these people, right?
That's how you feel, I know you do.

1871
01:47:15,394 --> 01:47:16,740
So look...

1872
01:47:18,984 --> 01:47:22,526
Let's, fucking, bet on this.
Let's bet on this shit.

1873
01:47:24,472 --> 01:47:27,838
I'm, fucking, gonna bet 
all this money on you tonight, KG.

1874
01:47:28,258 --> 01:47:31,158
You are here to win, KG, 
these fuckers don't know.

1875
01:47:31,455 --> 01:47:34,708
Them out, fucking, west. 
You think they, fucking, know you?

1876
01:47:34,855 --> 01:47:36,894
They don't know you, 
they don't know us.

1877
01:47:37,415 --> 01:47:40,712
It's about, fucking, winning, 
it's about you.

1878
01:47:41,060 --> 01:47:43,801
I saw your, fucking, conviction,

1879
01:47:43,964 --> 01:47:47,957
your, fucking, honesty 
and your, fucking, magic.

1880
01:47:48,420 --> 01:47:50,121
Howard, you're, fucking, crazy, man.

1881
01:47:50,121 --> 01:47:54,029
KG, do you even understand how, fucking, 
great of a game you gonna have tonight?

1882
01:47:54,029 --> 01:47:55,345
- I know it.
- Listen.

1883
01:47:55,345 --> 01:47:57,628
We're a team tonight, KG.

1884
01:47:57,776 --> 01:48:02,942
That is, fucking, lock, it's a, fucking, feeling.
We both have it, they don't know.

1885
01:48:03,225 --> 01:48:05,348
You and I know, all right?

1886
01:48:11,876 --> 01:48:13,754
Nice, fucking, watch too.

1887
01:48:15,453 --> 01:48:19,192
Hey, do you mind watching this place, 
while I run to the bathroom?

1888
01:48:19,380 --> 01:48:20,730
Thank you.

1889
01:48:21,123 --> 01:48:22,746
 Can I leave you guys alone in here?

1890
01:48:22,746 --> 01:48:24,873
- Go mind your business, sweetheart.
- Do you want company?

1891
01:48:24,873 --> 01:48:27,634
I don't think so, 
but next time maybe.

1892
01:48:31,556 --> 01:48:33,322
Hey, hey!
I'm looking for Howard.

1893
01:48:33,533 --> 01:48:35,320
I don't know where he is.
I'm fine. We're closed.

1894
01:48:35,320 --> 01:48:36,596
He gave me a, fucking, fake Rolex.

1895
01:48:36,723 --> 01:48:39,148
I have no idea about that, sir.
Please, come down.

1896
01:48:39,148 --> 01:48:41,454
- Val, can you, please, open up?
- Let me talk to you about this.

1897
01:48:41,629 --> 01:48:43,080
- You gotta help me.
- I'm sorry I'm leaving.

1898
01:48:43,111 --> 01:48:45,898
This is gonna be one of the best 
nights of our, fucking, life.

1899
01:48:45,898 --> 01:48:48,095
Howard.

1900
01:48:54,655 --> 01:48:57,310
Come on.

1901
01:48:57,627 --> 01:48:58,661
Where are you?

1902
01:48:59,112 --> 01:49:00,512
- Howard, what, the fuck, is going on?
- Take this.

1903
01:49:00,512 --> 01:49:02,773
- What is this?
- I need you to listen to me carefully.

1904
01:49:02,773 --> 01:49:07,063
I booked you on a Blade, okay?
You gonna land on top of the Mohegan Sun.

1905
01:49:07,286 --> 01:49:10,592
There's a bet in that bag. 
I want you to take all of it.

1906
01:49:10,592 --> 01:49:13,315
All of it inside the bag 
and place it on that bet.

1907
01:49:13,315 --> 01:49:14,996
- How much is in the bag?
- It's a lot.

1908
01:49:14,996 --> 01:49:17,103
 I don't want you to 
think about that, all right?

1909
01:49:17,103 --> 01:49:19,401
I don't even want you to look 
at that, until you get there,

1910
01:49:19,401 --> 01:49:21,754
and you take it out, and give it 
to the teller, you understand me?

1911
01:49:21,754 --> 01:49:22,667
Okay, I got it.

1912
01:49:22,667 --> 01:49:25,156
I'm gonna fuck the living shit 
out of you tonight, you know that?

1913
01:49:25,156 --> 01:49:26,529
I wish I could kiss you.

1914
01:49:26,772 --> 01:49:27,844
- You gotta go.
- Okay.

1915
01:49:27,844 --> 01:49:30,159
- You get going.
- All right, love you, bye.

1916
01:49:31,393 --> 01:49:32,398
Thank you, Jo.

1917
01:49:34,878 --> 01:49:36,327
Good to see you, Josh.

1918
01:49:40,965 --> 01:49:43,286
- All right, let's get this over with.
- Arno.

1919
01:49:43,628 --> 01:49:46,134
- You never gonna believe this shit.
- Believe what?

1920
01:49:46,134 --> 01:49:50,954
We are about to hit so, goddamn, big.
KG was just here, you saw him, right?

1921
01:49:50,954 --> 01:49:52,215
I gave him the gem.

1922
01:49:52,215 --> 01:49:55,055
He's gonna fuck up the money line 
so bad tonight.

1923
01:49:55,055 --> 01:49:56,669
Howard, where is the money right now?

1924
01:49:56,963 --> 01:49:59,925
It's on the way right now.
It's on the way to the casino.

1925
01:49:59,925 --> 01:50:02,389
What, the fuck, are you talking about, 
Howard?

1926
01:50:02,774 --> 01:50:05,012
- What, the fuck, is going on right here?
- Where is that girl?

1927
01:50:05,111 --> 01:50:06,576
- The girl that went to the bathroom.
- I haven't seen her.

1928
01:50:06,576 --> 01:50:08,186
- She didn't get back here?
- No.

1929
01:50:08,186 --> 01:50:10,523
- What are you not getting?
- No, it's in this room right now.

1930
01:50:10,607 --> 01:50:12,911
Go get her now, bring her back!

1931
01:50:13,496 --> 01:50:15,478
- Hey, handsome, hit the buzz.
- Open the, fucking, door!

1932
01:50:15,478 --> 01:50:17,517
Why, what am I 
opening the door for?

1933
01:50:17,517 --> 01:50:19,241
- Somebody, fucking, buzz me out.
- I got it, I got it.

1934
01:50:19,241 --> 01:50:20,747
- What are they doing?
- Let's go. Let's go!

1935
01:50:22,183 --> 01:50:24,263
- You're saying what?
- Put your hands off me!

1936
01:50:24,360 --> 01:50:25,560
What, the fuck, are we doing?

1937
01:50:25,560 --> 01:50:28,040
It's gonna make sense 
in about 2, fucking, minutes.

1938
01:50:28,577 --> 01:50:30,502
- Listen to what I'm telling.
- I'm listening.

1939
01:50:30,502 --> 01:50:31,655
You gonna do what 
I tell you to do.

1940
01:50:31,655 --> 01:50:34,163
Listen, you, fucking, goon, 
I'm telling you something...

1941
01:50:34,710 --> 01:50:35,990
Howard, listen to me!

1942
01:50:36,393 --> 01:50:38,400
Arno!

1943
01:50:40,720 --> 01:50:42,719
Get the, fucking, machine, now!

1944
01:50:43,025 --> 01:50:43,911
Arno!

1945
01:50:44,388 --> 01:50:46,363
- Shut the fuck up!
- What are you doing?

1946
01:50:50,170 --> 01:50:51,760
Wait, hey, come on, come on!

1947
01:50:54,752 --> 01:50:58,513
You want to get in touch with her?
I'll drop you on your fucking head, you hear me?

1948
01:50:59,661 --> 01:51:01,968
- Okay, get me up.
- You gonna call her?

1949
01:51:01,968 --> 01:51:04,905
- I'll call. I'll call. Please!
- You gonna get that bitch down here now?

1950
01:51:04,905 --> 01:51:05,954
Take me up!

1951
01:51:05,954 --> 01:51:08,682
All right, come one, get him up.
Get him up. Come on.

1952
01:51:10,122 --> 01:51:11,711
Listen, listen to me.

1953
01:51:11,964 --> 01:51:14,261
Pull yourself together, all right?

1954
01:51:14,427 --> 01:51:16,914
I want you to make that call.
You hear me?

1955
01:51:17,044 --> 01:51:17,770
Come on.

1956
01:51:17,770 --> 01:51:20,001
Give me a, fucking, second. Please.

1957
01:51:20,001 --> 01:51:21,971
You’ll have plenty of time, 
after you make the call.

1958
01:51:21,971 --> 01:51:23,044
My heart.

1959
01:51:23,187 --> 01:51:26,161
Call this girl up. 
I want her back here now.

1960
01:51:30,263 --> 01:51:32,126
She's at Mohegan Sun.

1961
01:51:32,513 --> 01:51:34,660
Come on, let's go.

1962
01:51:35,312 --> 01:51:37,088
Put her on speaker.

1963
01:51:40,399 --> 01:51:42,469
There you go.

1964
01:51:45,210 --> 01:51:47,418
This motherfucker.
Real Bruce Wayne.

1965
01:51:49,222 --> 01:51:51,107
Come on.

1966
01:51:57,306 --> 01:52:00,122
- I can't. I'm sorry.
- Fucking guy, I can't believe.

1967
01:52:00,122 --> 01:52:02,485
I'm sorry, I really am.
I am sorry.

1968
01:52:08,004 --> 01:52:09,660
Fuck this!

1969
01:52:10,267 --> 01:52:11,831
You're a moron.

1970
01:52:12,373 --> 01:52:13,384
Fuck it.

1971
01:52:13,384 --> 01:52:15,475
It's not worth it man, 
put this shit away.

1972
01:52:16,011 --> 01:52:17,047
- What are you doing?
- Buzz us out!

1973
01:52:17,047 --> 01:52:19,101
What are you doing?
What am I buzzing?

1974
01:52:19,101 --> 01:52:21,443
- Why are you...
- Just buzz me, the fuck, out!

1975
01:52:21,443 --> 01:52:23,199
- Watch the, fucking, game?
- Buzz me, the fuck, out!

1976
01:52:23,199 --> 01:52:25,217
- You'll be happy with the results.
- Buzz me out!

1977
01:52:25,217 --> 01:52:28,034
I'm telling you now, before I put 
your head through the, fucking, glass

1978
01:52:28,034 --> 01:52:30,292
All right, I'll buzz you out.
I'll buzz you out.

1979
01:52:34,224 --> 01:52:36,085
Close that door, man. Close it.

1980
01:52:37,254 --> 01:52:38,697
Fuck, buzz me out!

1981
01:52:40,738 --> 01:52:42,448
What are you doing?

1982
01:52:42,448 --> 01:52:44,483
Open the, fucking, door!

1983
01:52:47,412 --> 01:52:49,027
Howard, open the door.

1984
01:52:50,752 --> 01:52:52,116
I'm sorry.

1985
01:52:52,204 --> 01:52:54,037
I'm not buzzing you out.

1986
01:52:54,037 --> 01:52:57,862
Arno, the Sixers 
shouldn't even be there.

1987
01:52:58,185 --> 01:53:01,241
No, she's at the 
Mohegan Sun sports book.

1988
01:53:01,407 --> 01:53:05,625
Mohegan Sun sports book.
Get over there now!

1989
01:53:05,625 --> 01:53:07,785
You know what she, 
fucking, looks like, go find her!

1990
01:53:08,408 --> 01:53:09,989
Howard, open the door!

1991
01:53:09,989 --> 01:53:12,449
- I know you're upset, Arno.
- Of course, I'm upset!

1992
01:53:12,449 --> 01:53:15,020
I'm trying to, fucking, 
make this all work for you.

1993
01:53:15,193 --> 01:53:20,386
The NBA doesn't want the Sixers to win, 
there's no money in that, you understand?

1994
01:53:20,386 --> 01:53:22,881
The refs know that.
They want stars...

1995
01:53:22,881 --> 01:53:25,294
Buzz us, the fuck, out of here, 
Howard. Right now!

1996
01:53:25,580 --> 01:53:27,837
Open the door! Open it now!

1997
01:53:27,854 --> 01:53:31,097
This is, fucking, bulletproof, 
you only gonna hurt yourself.

1998
01:53:31,211 --> 01:53:32,981
- That doesn't work.
- I'm telling you to open it!

1999
01:53:32,981 --> 01:53:35,309
Arno, I'd duck, 
you're gonna get killed.

2000
01:53:35,572 --> 01:53:39,139
Listen to me. Thank you...
I'm talking to Arno.

2001
01:53:39,308 --> 01:53:41,478
- Enough of you! Enough!
- You gotta open this, fucking, door.

2002
01:53:41,478 --> 01:53:43,155
Listen to me.

2003
01:53:43,155 --> 01:53:46,066
You realize all he's gotta do is 
get the opening tip,

2004
01:53:46,066 --> 01:53:47,515
- he's gotta get the, fucking...
- buzz this, fucking...

2005
01:53:47,515 --> 01:53:51,346
We gonna get, you know how many 
rebounds this guy's gonna get, Arno?

2006
01:53:51,532 --> 01:53:53,501
Who is that?
Who are you talking to?

2007
01:53:53,501 --> 01:53:56,017
Who'd you call?
Who did you call?

2008
01:53:56,712 --> 01:53:58,846
Open the, fucking, door, dick!

2009
01:54:10,780 --> 01:54:12,525
- Yeah?
- Yeah, it's me.

2010
01:54:12,525 --> 01:54:13,518
Make it quick, 'cause...

2011
01:54:13,518 --> 01:54:16,632
- ConEd called, the office, there's a, fucking, leak.
- What leak?

2012
01:54:16,632 --> 01:54:20,901
There's a gas leak on Pinoak.
So they are evacuating the whole block.

2013
01:54:20,901 --> 01:54:23,343
- Just slow down, okay?
- So get the kids out of there, all right?

2014
01:54:23,343 --> 01:54:25,610
- You and the kids go to Amy’s.
- Well, why would they call the office

2015
01:54:25,610 --> 01:54:26,765
- Stay at Amy's.
- and not the...

2016
01:54:26,765 --> 01:54:28,721
I don't know why they 
called, me, all right?

2017
01:54:28,721 --> 01:54:29,852
That's not making any sense, Howard.

2018
01:54:29,852 --> 01:54:31,550
I'm not here to argue with you!

2019
01:54:31,621 --> 01:54:35,256
Dinah, get the kids out of the house, 
I'm frightened, okay?

2020
01:54:35,309 --> 01:54:37,476
- You're freaking me out.
- Just get out, go to Amy's.

2021
01:54:37,476 --> 01:54:39,574
And do not leave there, 
until I get home.

2022
01:54:40,061 --> 01:54:42,336
- You promise me? Stay at the house.
- Okay.

2023
01:54:42,336 --> 01:54:43,610
- Okay?
- You'll meet us there?

2024
01:54:43,610 --> 01:54:45,758
Yes. All right, thank you.
Thank you.

2025
01:54:45,969 --> 01:54:47,739
Open the, fucking, door!

2026
01:54:47,987 --> 01:54:50,321
Last year, I made a 125 million dollars.

2027
01:54:50,486 --> 01:54:52,223
I don't even know what to do 
with my money anymore.

2028
01:54:52,223 --> 01:54:56,087
I got nobody to spend it with, 
nobody to enjoy my life with anymore, it’s horrible.

2029
01:54:56,569 --> 01:54:58,569
Today is the big day to be, I thank you.

2030
01:54:59,370 --> 01:55:01,173
You wanna have a drink with me 
when we get there?

2031
01:55:32,728 --> 01:55:34,017
- Hey.
- Hey.

2032
01:55:34,017 --> 01:55:39,112
Okay, so I'm betting on the Celtics, 
parlay, three-way,

2033
01:55:39,112 --> 01:55:40,885
money, I don't know, plus...
Have here, you just...

2034
01:55:41,115 --> 01:55:42,704
So you wanna parlay, three-way...

2035
01:55:42,704 --> 01:55:44,960
Make sure that one you put in 
it's exactly that, okay?

2036
01:55:44,960 --> 01:55:46,461
I will, how much you want on it?

2037
01:55:46,461 --> 01:55:49,034
Okay, I'm not really sure, 
You just gonna have to.

2038
01:55:49,953 --> 01:55:52,080
Okay. Chad?

2039
01:55:52,197 --> 01:55:54,795
Okay, just give me a minute.
I just have to get my supervisor

2040
01:55:54,959 --> 01:55:56,787
- count this, okay?
- Okay.

2041
01:55:59,184 --> 01:56:00,946
- We're almost there.
- One second.

2042
01:56:19,036 --> 01:56:20,934
Come on. Let's go.

2043
01:56:21,919 --> 01:56:24,376
I'm feeling this.

2044
01:56:26,196 --> 01:56:27,395
Beautiful.

2045
01:56:27,395 --> 01:56:30,012
From Bergen County, Number 5.

2046
01:56:30,012 --> 01:56:31,994
This is it.

2047
01:56:31,994 --> 01:56:34,975
Kevin Garnett!

2048
01:56:35,077 --> 01:56:37,155
Hi, tell me.

2049
01:56:39,044 --> 01:56:42,729
Okay, listen, listen. Say it.
Say the whole ticket out loud.

2050
01:56:42,729 --> 01:56:45,041
I want you to say it really loud.
Give me a second.

2051
01:56:45,041 --> 01:56:48,014
I want some people to hear it, all right?
Hang on. Hang on.

2052
01:56:48,383 --> 01:56:49,963
Say the whole ticket. 
Go ahead.

2053
01:56:50,126 --> 01:56:54,928
I put 155 on the three-way bet.
Garnett’s points plus his rebounds.

2054
01:56:55,097 --> 01:56:58,917
Celtics money line with 
the Celtics to win the opening tip.

2055
01:56:59,046 --> 01:57:01,981
Right, just read the whole ticket.
Read the whole ticket.

2056
01:57:02,200 --> 01:57:04,395
Okay, so it says here...

2057
01:57:04,476 --> 01:57:06,494
- You're having a good time?
- Yes.

2058
01:57:06,518 --> 01:57:10,069
1 million 229 thousand.

2059
01:57:10,069 --> 01:57:11,679
Did you fucking hear that number?

2060
01:57:11,679 --> 01:57:13,769
That's enough. 
You don't have to say anymore.

2061
01:57:13,827 --> 01:57:15,582
The bet's in.

2062
01:57:15,582 --> 01:57:16,649
- Okay?
- Fuck you!

2063
01:57:16,649 --> 01:57:19,751
I'm taking you to the, fucking, 
the Ritz-Carlton in the Grand Cayman.

2064
01:57:19,766 --> 01:57:21,804
All right? With the, fucking, jacuzzi.

2065
01:57:22,004 --> 01:57:24,266
- All right. Rob that tattoo for me.
- Okay, I love you.

2066
01:57:25,695 --> 01:57:26,918
Okay, here we go.

2067
01:57:27,196 --> 01:57:30,560
We grab this tip, and 
we're in business, boys, all right?

2068
01:57:31,315 --> 01:57:33,466
Pound that chest, baby! 
This is it.

2069
01:57:33,739 --> 01:57:35,563
We gotta get this. 
This is right out of the gate.

2070
01:57:35,735 --> 01:57:36,851
Right out of the gate.

2071
01:57:37,364 --> 01:57:39,710
Come on.

2072
01:57:41,800 --> 01:57:44,689
Get that tip, let's go 
get that, fucking, tip.

2073
01:57:45,340 --> 01:57:46,801
Get that tip.

2074
01:57:47,144 --> 01:57:48,671
Let's go.

2075
01:57:52,302 --> 01:57:55,451
Get that! Yes! Yes!

2076
01:57:55,783 --> 01:57:58,214
Fuck, we would've been fucked,
if he didn't get that.

2077
01:57:58,342 --> 01:58:01,798
That was the, fucking, biggest part 
of the whole, goddamn, parlay right there.

2078
01:58:01,798 --> 01:58:03,014
That was huge.

2079
01:58:03,014 --> 01:58:05,780
I knew he was gonna win that.

2080
01:58:06,244 --> 01:58:08,323
All right, that's it.

2081
01:58:12,554 --> 01:58:14,326
That’s one! 
That’s, fucking, one.

2082
01:58:14,326 --> 01:58:15,515
Look at that.

2083
01:58:15,592 --> 01:58:17,532
Right out of the, fucking, gate.
The man.

2084
01:58:17,658 --> 01:58:19,559
The man's feeling the gem!

2085
01:58:20,367 --> 01:58:21,934
Go, get it, get it to him.

2086
01:58:22,866 --> 01:58:24,937
Go. Go.
Finish it. Finish it.

2087
01:58:26,006 --> 01:58:27,937
Yes, all right, that's, fucking, it.

2088
01:58:28,033 --> 01:58:31,182
That's the first shot of the game.
He, fucking, did it. That's 3 now.

2089
01:58:31,571 --> 01:58:34,496
Two plus, that, fucking, rebound.
That’s 3 of the 26!

2090
01:58:34,556 --> 01:58:36,384
Okay, I bet on...

2091
01:58:36,565 --> 01:58:39,115
I bet on the Celtics, 
specifically, Kevin Garnett.

2092
01:58:39,248 --> 01:58:43,977
Okay, 2 good bets: Celtics are winning
and Garnett's got 9 and 7, so...

2093
01:58:44,517 --> 01:58:48,098
That's 16 right now 
on the way to 26 you said, right?

2094
01:58:48,115 --> 01:58:50,221
- The gorgeous one is here.
- Not even half time yet.

2095
01:58:50,221 --> 01:58:52,043
Twice in one day, I can't believe it.

2096
01:58:52,043 --> 01:58:53,669
How are you? 
From the helicopter to here.

2097
01:58:53,816 --> 01:58:56,267
How are you doing, baby?
I can't kick you out of my mind.

2098
01:58:57,758 --> 01:58:58,522
You're funny.

2099
01:58:58,657 --> 01:59:00,419
Hi, baby, you're, definitely, hot.

2100
01:59:00,764 --> 01:59:02,589
What, you got money on the Celtics?

2101
01:59:02,969 --> 01:59:04,545
- Let me see, baby.
- Is he gonna shoot?

2102
01:59:05,718 --> 01:59:07,696
Come on, Garnett, 
that one's gonna happen.

2103
01:59:07,696 --> 01:59:10,906
Oh, come on, man, I mean,
so he missed a shot, who cares?

2104
01:59:12,035 --> 01:59:14,022
I have a great idea 
for the halftime, okay?

2105
01:59:14,142 --> 01:59:15,899
- What's that?
- I'd like you to come up to my room.

2106
01:59:15,899 --> 01:59:19,235
I hired the chef, I'm at penthouse A.
And I got the... It's gorgeous.

2107
01:59:19,637 --> 01:59:22,043
Best views, I mean, who can 
ask for more than that?

2108
01:59:22,123 --> 01:59:24,723
- Thank you.
- I love you, baby, I'll see you there.

2109
01:59:24,981 --> 01:59:27,338
- Okay, yes, got it.
- Penthouse A, The PennyRoyal.

2110
01:59:29,154 --> 01:59:30,725
Okay, bye.

2111
01:59:30,725 --> 01:59:31,449
Wow.

2112
01:59:31,449 --> 01:59:33,554
- Fucking worst.
- He's like a cartoon.

2113
01:59:35,707 --> 01:59:37,042
You okay?

2114
01:59:39,539 --> 01:59:40,589
What happened?

2115
01:59:46,961 --> 01:59:47,836
I gotta go.

2116
01:59:47,836 --> 01:59:51,337
- What's going on, you need help?
- Thank you so much for your help.

2117
02:00:07,926 --> 02:00:11,030
This is the beauty of betting.

2118
02:00:11,152 --> 02:00:11,914
You know?

2119
02:00:11,914 --> 02:00:14,585
I'm, fucking, pulling for the Celtics.
The Knicks fan.

2120
02:00:15,338 --> 02:00:18,865
If the, fucking, 12 year old version 
of me saw me right now,

2121
02:00:18,865 --> 02:00:20,066
he's be like "what the fuck"?

2122
02:00:20,123 --> 02:00:22,778
Everybody's talking 
about this, fucking, big bet.

2123
02:00:23,835 --> 02:00:25,224
So it's gotta be her.

2124
02:00:25,496 --> 02:00:29,517
He's with me, we're gonna, fucking, 
find her and bring her back, boss.

2125
02:00:30,038 --> 02:00:32,233
Boss, absolutely.

2126
02:00:32,233 --> 02:00:35,802
I need everyone in here 
to lock in KG.

2127
02:00:36,058 --> 02:00:37,452
Look at KG!

2128
02:00:37,743 --> 02:00:41,426
Remember this: 
if you wanna go quickly - do it alone,

2129
02:00:42,004 --> 02:00:45,719
but if you wanna 
go far - you do it together!

2130
02:00:46,191 --> 02:00:48,827
We're like roaches.
And you can't kill us.

2131
02:00:48,864 --> 02:00:50,617
Quit, fucking, passing.
Give it to him.

2132
02:00:51,131 --> 02:00:52,230
And another, and another.

2133
02:00:52,230 --> 02:00:54,297
And shoot. Shoot. Shoot.

2134
02:00:54,907 --> 02:00:57,312
Fuck that shit!
Fucking Doc!

2135
02:00:58,153 --> 02:01:00,992
Fucking, threw his rhythm off,
it took him out of the game.

2136
02:01:01,430 --> 02:01:03,951
Fuck, man!
That's your fault!

2137
02:01:04,618 --> 02:01:06,791
You see that other guy?
Yo, Phil.

2138
02:01:06,917 --> 02:01:10,085
What, your boys from Boston?
You got some boys in Boston?

2139
02:01:10,408 --> 02:01:11,947
You'll see them locked on, hang on.

2140
02:01:12,563 --> 02:01:15,438
This fucker, is that 
one of your boys, that fat fuck?

2141
02:01:15,469 --> 02:01:17,894
Looks like you.
Looks like one of your boys.

2142
02:01:20,070 --> 02:01:23,322
That a, fucking, rebound!
That's it, 3 more!

2143
02:01:23,519 --> 02:01:25,125
Three more. Way to go!

2144
02:01:25,270 --> 02:01:27,442
What does it say up there,
what is the score?

2145
02:01:27,847 --> 02:01:28,823
Are we winning?

2146
02:01:28,823 --> 02:01:31,594
They’re winning. 
They’re winning by 3 points.

2147
02:01:31,594 --> 02:01:33,559
Fuck that shit!
He, fucking, fouled.

2148
02:01:33,974 --> 02:01:35,883
Doesn't matter, 
he grabbed it, he had it.

2149
02:01:36,167 --> 02:01:38,617
That counts as 1.
What are we at, 23?

2150
02:01:41,166 --> 02:01:43,007
All right, last possession. 
Let's go.

2151
02:01:43,007 --> 02:01:45,712
Good, pick it up.
All right. That's it. That's it.

2152
02:01:45,868 --> 02:01:49,494
Shoot that shit!
Come on K, shoot it, shoot it!

2153
02:01:53,394 --> 02:01:56,741
Holy fuck! Yeah!
Let's, fucking, do it!

2154
02:01:57,751 --> 02:01:59,911
Just, fucking...
That's all the gem.

2155
02:02:00,227 --> 02:02:01,513
That's all the gem.

2156
02:02:02,976 --> 02:02:05,719
We're at 25 now. One more!

2157
02:02:06,040 --> 02:02:10,441
One more, fucking point, 
either a rebound, or a, fucking, basket.

2158
02:02:10,616 --> 02:02:13,213
Anything. 
Either one and we, fucking, got this.

2159
02:02:14,426 --> 02:02:16,543
All right, one more.
We just need one more.

2160
02:02:17,303 --> 02:02:18,642
- Oh my God.
- Hi.

2161
02:02:18,642 --> 02:02:21,478
Come on in.
Three times in one day.

2162
02:02:21,756 --> 02:02:23,144
- I know, I know.
- Unbelievable.

2163
02:02:23,411 --> 02:02:25,332
And I said that...
I believe it's you.

2164
02:02:25,332 --> 02:02:27,718
- Where's your boyfriend?
- Why don't we watch the game?

2165
02:02:27,718 --> 02:02:29,866
Go ahead, sit there, 
make yourself comfortable.

2166
02:02:30,234 --> 02:02:31,975
Where's the remo, 
what do I do?

2167
02:02:31,975 --> 02:02:35,014
The iPad is over there, 
do what you gotta do with the iPad.

2168
02:02:35,018 --> 02:02:37,533
I gotta take a shower, okay?
I really need gotta take a shower.

2169
02:02:37,533 --> 02:02:39,332
I gotta clean up, okay?
To get myself washed.

2170
02:02:39,629 --> 02:02:42,105
That plane ride, 
it got me all messed up.

2171
02:02:42,348 --> 02:02:45,532
So what I want you to do.
If that door bell rings, okay?

2172
02:02:45,875 --> 02:02:49,668
I got my friends, okay, coming in,
or I got the food coming, okay?

2173
02:02:49,668 --> 02:02:51,094
You just answer and let them in.

2174
02:02:51,094 --> 02:02:53,533
- Okay. All right.
- Okay, baby? Please.

2175
02:02:57,965 --> 02:02:59,566
That's it!

2176
02:03:00,804 --> 02:03:02,853
Thank you.

2177
02:03:03,590 --> 02:03:05,590
That's it, okay? That's 2 done.

2178
02:03:06,732 --> 02:03:08,436
We got that. Two.

2179
02:03:08,436 --> 02:03:11,434
We just gotta win now. 
Celts gotta win and we're, fucking, done.

2180
02:03:11,434 --> 02:03:13,117
We're done, Arno.

2181
02:03:15,650 --> 02:03:17,535
What do you got?
What's the score, baby?

2182
02:03:17,607 --> 02:03:20,817
- 68/73, Boston.
- 68 what in the 4th?

2183
02:03:21,741 --> 02:03:23,932
You wanna call down 
and just cancel the, fucking, food.

2184
02:03:23,932 --> 02:03:25,360
I wanna go out.

2185
02:03:25,360 --> 02:03:27,523
Baby, I love that 
you’re into this game.

2186
02:03:38,613 --> 02:03:39,845
Push that.

2187
02:03:39,845 --> 02:03:41,210
Push it!

2188
02:03:41,210 --> 02:03:41,875
Go!

2189
02:03:41,879 --> 02:03:44,427
Go to the, fucking, hole.
Get in, KG, get in!

2190
02:03:44,557 --> 02:03:46,026
Oh, don't, fucking, miss that!

2191
02:03:46,026 --> 02:03:48,308
Don't miss that. 
That's all right.

2192
02:03:48,667 --> 02:03:51,978
That's all right. 
KG is gonna get this, fucking, shot.

2193
02:03:52,518 --> 02:03:53,840
That's how you steal shit.

2194
02:03:54,620 --> 02:03:55,472
Sink that shot.

2195
02:03:55,610 --> 02:03:56,832
Sink it.

2196
02:03:57,119 --> 02:03:57,821
Come on, feel it.

2197
02:03:57,821 --> 02:03:59,800
Feel it.

2198
02:04:00,072 --> 02:04:01,550
Come on, he's got the gem.

2199
02:04:01,840 --> 02:04:04,001
He's got the gem.
Feel that, fucking, gem.

2200
02:04:04,001 --> 02:04:05,799
Feel it.

2201
02:04:12,057 --> 02:04:14,366
Fuck.
It's all right, it's all right.

2202
02:04:14,880 --> 02:04:17,100
All right. We're up enough.
We're up enough.

2203
02:04:17,426 --> 02:04:19,031
This is not that big of a deal.

2204
02:04:19,094 --> 02:04:21,253
This, fucking, helps seal it,
but we're good.

2205
02:04:21,762 --> 02:04:24,109
Don't talk, just, fucking, 
do your shit, man.

2206
02:04:24,640 --> 02:04:26,315
Do your shit.

2207
02:04:28,149 --> 02:04:30,153
Get this shit, come on.

2208
02:04:32,487 --> 02:04:34,370
Yeah!

2209
02:04:37,875 --> 02:04:40,025
I'm confident now.
I'm confident.

2210
02:04:40,682 --> 02:04:43,113
Don't let them shoot that.

2211
02:04:43,620 --> 02:04:45,844
Get that!
Yes!

2212
02:04:46,660 --> 02:04:48,100
Oh my God!

2213
02:04:48,201 --> 02:04:49,580
Yeah!

2214
02:04:50,432 --> 02:04:51,801
Oh my God!

2215
02:04:53,494 --> 02:04:54,614
Holy shit!

2216
02:04:55,589 --> 02:04:56,680
Holy, fucking, shit!

2217
02:04:57,405 --> 02:04:58,565
Oh my God!

2218
02:05:00,531 --> 02:05:01,531
Oh my God!

2219
02:05:04,622 --> 02:05:06,952
Howard? Did we just win?

2220
02:05:07,025 --> 02:05:09,775
Oh my, fucking, God!
Are you kidding me?

2221
02:05:10,162 --> 02:05:12,093
Oh my God!

2222
02:05:12,447 --> 02:05:13,512
Holy shit!

2223
02:05:13,779 --> 02:05:14,705
I love you, baby.

2224
02:05:14,763 --> 02:05:17,436
I love you.

2225
02:05:18,530 --> 02:05:23,856
I love you.

2226
02:05:25,246 --> 02:05:26,606
Arno!

2227
02:05:26,804 --> 02:05:30,162
He, fucking, did it.

2228
02:05:31,079 --> 02:05:32,606
He, fucking, did it.

2229
02:05:33,243 --> 02:05:35,380
I know. I know, thank you.

2230
02:05:35,657 --> 02:05:37,489
Thank you.

2231
02:05:37,569 --> 02:05:39,544
No, you, you.
I love you.

2232
02:05:39,544 --> 02:05:42,095
I love you.
I'm so happy, it's, fucking...

2233
02:05:42,406 --> 02:05:44,594
It's going down.

2234
02:05:45,129 --> 02:05:47,131
- Arno.
- You won, you made your point. Let's go.

2235
02:05:47,131 --> 02:05:48,177
All righty.

2236
02:05:48,553 --> 02:05:50,756
Okay, listen. 
Yes.

2237
02:05:51,460 --> 02:05:53,261
You just cash that in, okay?

2238
02:05:53,261 --> 02:05:56,035
And make sure they, 
fucking, walk you into the car.

2239
02:05:56,557 --> 02:05:58,407
All right? 
I’m gonna book you a Blade.

2240
02:05:58,407 --> 02:06:00,584
- Howard.
- All right, I'll call you back.

2241
02:06:00,584 --> 02:06:02,506
- Son of a bitch.
- Arno?

2242
02:06:02,805 --> 02:06:04,625
- I can't, fucking, believe.
- I did it, Arno.

2243
02:06:06,818 --> 02:06:08,328
What, the fuck, did you just do?

2244
02:06:11,477 --> 02:06:13,512
Shut up!
Get me bags now!

2245
02:06:15,250 --> 02:06:17,188
Let go off me.
Shut, the fuck, up!

2246
02:06:17,466 --> 02:06:19,455
Or you'll wind up next to him, 
you hear me?

2247
02:06:19,629 --> 02:06:21,263
Don't, fucking, confuse me though.

2248
02:06:23,896 --> 02:06:25,528
Take your hands off me right now!

2249
02:06:25,954 --> 02:06:28,025
Go ahead!

2250
02:06:28,578 --> 02:06:31,075
Do it!
What did I say? Do it!

2251
02:06:32,699 --> 02:06:34,678
I want out of here.
Let me out of here!

2252
02:06:35,406 --> 02:06:36,505
Let me out!

2253
02:06:37,608 --> 02:06:40,282
Go get the bags, now!
I'll fix this.

2254
02:06:43,148 --> 02:06:44,714
- Get off me.
- Stay right there!

2255
02:06:44,714 --> 02:06:46,034
Stay right, fucking, there!

2256
02:06:47,058 --> 02:06:48,508
Come on, let's go!

2257
02:06:55,099 --> 02:06:57,286
Get out! 
Get the fuck out!

2258
02:07:05,291 --> 02:07:08,999
You are heading to the finals.
How are you feeling?

2259
02:07:09,164 --> 02:07:11,604
When you win, 
it’s all that matters, you know.

2260
02:07:11,742 --> 02:07:13,967
The big quiet, 
the big shut up, you know.

2261
02:07:14,641 --> 02:07:16,318
To them doubters, 
to them haters.

2262
02:07:16,318 --> 02:07:17,914
Bring it in.

2263
02:07:17,914 --> 02:07:19,452
Get that, motherfucking, money, right?

2264
02:07:19,620 --> 02:07:20,913
And a personal one to you blood.

2265
02:07:20,913 --> 02:07:25,004
You just celebrated your 36th birthday,
to everyone who's saying you're too old...

2266
02:07:25,167 --> 02:07:26,329
Some strong shit!

2267
02:07:27,227 --> 02:07:29,966
That's my nigga right there!
Look at that motherfucker, man!

2268
02:07:30,381 --> 02:07:32,381
I know him! I know that guy!
I know him!

2269
02:07:33,390 --> 02:07:35,536
My dad sold a ring to him!

2270
02:07:35,672 --> 02:07:39,046
Hey, I can't think!
Amy, he was naked in the trunk.

2271
02:07:39,443 --> 02:07:40,933
I'm calling the police.

2272
02:07:41,123 --> 02:07:45,308
All the dues, and everything I put into this.
You might think that I will show up to game 7.

2273
02:07:46,144 --> 02:07:47,274
Yeah, that's a joke.

2274
02:07:52,512 --> 02:07:54,206
It's all there.
Thank you.

2275
02:08:07,769 --> 02:08:10,356
In the end, I felt like 
it was me and the rock.

2276
02:08:10,490 --> 02:08:11,647
Nothing else.

2277
02:08:22,562 --> 02:08:25,148
Oh my God, Wayne.
Thank you so much.

2278
02:08:25,148 --> 02:08:26,702
- My pleasure.
- Thank you.

2279
02:08:27,338 --> 02:08:29,326
Listen, I want you to come here, 
and I'll have one drink.

2280
02:08:29,326 --> 02:08:31,616
No. I gotta go. 
Bye, baby.

2281
02:08:31,616 --> 02:08:33,523
- I gotta go.
- Let's go down for one drink.

2282
02:08:33,747 --> 02:08:35,058
We can go now.

2283
02:08:35,679 --> 02:08:38,122
Nico, go in the back.
I got it.

2284
02:08:38,550 --> 02:08:39,745
Let's go.

2285
02:08:40,268 --> 02:08:41,142
Go! Go!

2286
02:08:41,142 --> 02:08:42,623
On the, fucking, cameras.

2287
02:08:43,215 --> 02:08:44,267
All right. Go! Go!

2288
02:08:44,751 --> 02:08:45,771
Okay, I got you.

2289
02:08:47,108 --> 02:08:49,072
- Nico? 
- I can't find the cameras!

2290
02:08:49,373 --> 02:08:51,154
Make you get all those in the trunk.

2291
02:10:17,890 --> 02:10:22,606
