1
00:00:43,669 --> 00:00:45,402
Where you going, Violet?

2
00:00:45,404 --> 00:00:47,471
Just to pick some flowers.

3
00:00:47,473 --> 00:00:49,475
Don't wander too far.

4
00:00:56,180 --> 00:01:01,751
<i>♪ My wild Irish rose ♪</i>

5
00:01:01,753 --> 00:01:07,189
<i>♪ The sweetest flower
That grows ♪</i>

6
00:01:07,191 --> 00:01:10,559
<i>♪ You may search everywhere ♪</i>

7
00:01:10,561 --> 00:01:13,162
<i>♪ But none can compare ♪</i>

8
00:01:13,164 --> 00:01:19,835
<i>♪ With my wild Irish rose ♪</i>

9
00:01:19,837 --> 00:01:21,472
Well, hi there.

10
00:01:24,408 --> 00:01:26,042
Do you want one?

11
00:01:35,786 --> 00:01:38,121
You're wondering why
I'm wearing such a funny hat.

12
00:01:39,289 --> 00:01:42,123
I always wear this hat.

13
00:01:42,125 --> 00:01:44,760
So much,
it's a part of my name now.

14
00:01:44,762 --> 00:01:46,529
My friends,

15
00:01:46,531 --> 00:01:48,496
my very, very best friends,

16
00:01:48,498 --> 00:01:51,165
they just call me
Rose the Hat.

17
00:01:51,167 --> 00:01:54,202
It looks like
a magician's hat.

18
00:01:54,204 --> 00:01:55,838
It is.

19
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,506
It's a magic hat.

20
00:01:58,508 --> 00:01:59,543
Do you wanna see?

21
00:02:01,478 --> 00:02:03,113
Nothing up my sleeves.

22
00:02:04,648 --> 00:02:06,848
Nothing in my hat.

23
00:02:09,853 --> 00:02:11,319
Don't worry, that's my friend.

24
00:02:11,321 --> 00:02:12,754
You're missing the trick.

25
00:02:12,756 --> 00:02:14,691
Reach inside.

26
00:02:19,429 --> 00:02:21,194
Wow!

27
00:02:21,196 --> 00:02:22,397
It's so pretty.

28
00:02:22,399 --> 00:02:24,197
Because it's special.

29
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:26,233
And speaking of special,

30
00:02:26,235 --> 00:02:28,371
you're a little magic, too,
aren't you?

31
00:02:30,306 --> 00:02:33,175
The flower in my hand,
what color is it?

32
00:02:35,679 --> 00:02:36,746
Purple.

33
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:44,119
Violet,

34
00:02:44,854 --> 00:02:46,355
like you.

35
00:02:49,191 --> 00:02:50,791
You don't eat flowers.

36
00:02:50,793 --> 00:02:52,292
But you do.

37
00:02:52,294 --> 00:02:54,494
But these are special.

38
00:02:54,496 --> 00:02:58,434
Honey, it's the special ones
that taste best.

39
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:03,403
I should get back to my mom.

40
00:03:03,405 --> 00:03:06,342
No, stay. Stay awhile.
See more magic.

41
00:03:11,413 --> 00:03:13,212
- Ow.
- You are a special

42
00:03:13,214 --> 00:03:14,617
little thing, aren't you?

43
00:06:00,645 --> 00:06:02,647
No, no, no. Please.

44
00:06:06,851 --> 00:06:09,287
Hey. It's okay, Doc.

45
00:06:10,388 --> 00:06:12,057
It's okay.

46
00:06:17,695 --> 00:06:19,128
There.

47
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:20,865
All dry.

48
00:06:24,102 --> 00:06:25,670
What happened?

49
00:06:28,706 --> 00:06:30,809
You have to talk to me, Danny.

50
00:06:31,976 --> 00:06:34,612
You haven't talked
since we left...

51
00:06:35,847 --> 00:06:37,849
Please, Doc.

52
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:41,451
Please.

53
00:06:55,033 --> 00:06:56,999
So,

54
00:06:57,001 --> 00:06:59,636
you ain't talking, huh, Doc?

55
00:07:03,941 --> 00:07:07,444
Weren't talking much
first time I met you neither.

56
00:07:09,546 --> 00:07:12,447
You remember the first time
we really talked?

57
00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:15,984
When I spoke up
inside your head?

58
00:07:15,986 --> 00:07:18,420
<i>Made you feel good, right?</i>

59
00:07:18,422 --> 00:07:20,956
<i>Knowing you weren't alone.</i>

60
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:23,925
Someone did that for me, too.

61
00:07:23,927 --> 00:07:28,163
And some day, Danny Torrance,
you'll teach someone else.

62
00:07:28,165 --> 00:07:29,565
I won't.

63
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:31,733
Oh, you won't, huh?

64
00:07:31,735 --> 00:07:33,434
I won't shine, I mean.

65
00:07:33,436 --> 00:07:36,838
No more. It's dangerous.

66
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,540
Reckon it is sometimes.

67
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:41,042
She found me.

68
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:43,779
She'll come back and come back
until she gets me.

69
00:07:44,814 --> 00:07:46,580
You're right.

70
00:07:46,582 --> 00:07:48,883
The Overlook's condemned.
Boarded up.

71
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:50,684
They're starvin' old ghosts,

72
00:07:50,686 --> 00:07:52,753
and they're reachin' out
for you.

73
00:07:52,755 --> 00:07:54,855
Won't stop with her, either.

74
00:07:54,857 --> 00:07:56,690
Pictures in a book.

75
00:07:56,692 --> 00:07:58,659
You said they were just
pictures in a book

76
00:07:58,661 --> 00:07:59,762
and they couldn't hurt me.

77
00:08:02,531 --> 00:08:04,632
Some things,

78
00:08:04,634 --> 00:08:08,769
dark things,
the shining's like food.

79
00:08:08,771 --> 00:08:10,671
The Overlook,

80
00:08:10,673 --> 00:08:14,540
it was always just pictures
to me.

81
00:08:14,542 --> 00:08:17,845
But I didn't shine like you.

82
00:08:17,847 --> 00:08:21,048
Nobody shines like you.

83
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:23,217
So, you in that damn hotel,

84
00:08:23,219 --> 00:08:25,920
you was like
a million-watt battery

85
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,553
all plugged in.

86
00:08:27,555 --> 00:08:29,691
And it ate it up.

87
00:08:31,127 --> 00:08:34,894
World's a hungry place.

88
00:08:34,896 --> 00:08:36,829
And the darkest things
are the hungriest,

89
00:08:36,831 --> 00:08:38,898
and they'll eat what shines.

90
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:42,535
Swarm it like mosquitoes
or leeches.

91
00:08:42,537 --> 00:08:44,940
Can't do nothing about that.

92
00:08:46,508 --> 00:08:49,208
What you can do

93
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:52,881
is turn what they come for
against 'em.

94
00:08:55,717 --> 00:08:58,584
My grandfather,

95
00:08:58,586 --> 00:09:01,522
he was a mean son of a bitch.

96
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:04,023
Dark inside.

97
00:09:04,025 --> 00:09:06,859
Same type of dark as your dad.

98
00:09:06,861 --> 00:09:09,796
Beat me senseless,
and my grandma, too,

99
00:09:09,798 --> 00:09:12,031
and when he died, I danced.

100
00:09:12,033 --> 00:09:14,702
But he kept on coming back.

101
00:09:15,736 --> 00:09:18,137
Standing in my room.

102
00:09:18,139 --> 00:09:20,974
Suit all gray and stinkin'

103
00:09:20,976 --> 00:09:25,010
from whatever mold was growin'
on him in that box.

104
00:09:25,012 --> 00:09:26,780
So, Grandma,

105
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:32,019
she taught me a trick.

106
00:09:33,954 --> 00:09:37,589
Gave me a present.

107
00:09:37,591 --> 00:09:41,028
I want you to know this box

108
00:09:41,829 --> 00:09:43,862
inside and out.

109
00:09:43,864 --> 00:09:47,165
Don't just look at it.
Touch it.

110
00:09:47,167 --> 00:09:50,302
Stick your nose inside
and see if there's a smell.

111
00:09:50,304 --> 00:09:52,137
Why?

112
00:09:52,139 --> 00:09:55,841
Because you're gonna build one
just like it in your mind.

113
00:09:55,843 --> 00:09:57,943
One even more special.

114
00:09:57,945 --> 00:10:00,513
So next time
that bitch comes around,

115
00:10:01,048 --> 00:10:02,615
you'll be ready.

116
00:10:04,084 --> 00:10:05,718
Let's get you back to Mama.

117
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,619
Danny!

118
00:10:08,621 --> 00:10:10,523
Danny!

119
00:10:12,359 --> 00:10:14,959
Danny!

120
00:10:14,961 --> 00:10:17,028
There you are.

121
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:19,199
Where did you go, huh?

122
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:23,102
You scared me half to death.

123
00:10:24,804 --> 00:10:27,671
Don't you do that to me.
You hear?

124
00:10:27,673 --> 00:10:30,074
Don't you ever do that to me.

125
00:10:30,076 --> 00:10:32,078
Don't ever do that to me.

126
00:10:37,917 --> 00:10:41,986
<i>Eh, what's up, Doc?</i>

127
00:10:41,988 --> 00:10:43,854
<i>What's the bit?</i>

128
00:10:43,856 --> 00:10:46,924
<i>What's cookin'?</i>

129
00:10:46,926 --> 00:10:50,161
<i>What's cooking,
little friend? Why, you are.</i>

130
00:10:50,163 --> 00:10:51,295
<i>Me?</i>

131
00:10:51,297 --> 00:10:54,033
<i>Why, yes.</i>

132
00:10:56,102 --> 00:10:58,937
<i>Ouch!
You're killing me!</i>

133
00:11:00,339 --> 00:11:01,606
<i>Ouch!</i>

134
00:11:07,346 --> 00:11:09,881
<i>Agony! Agony!</i>

135
00:11:48,286 --> 00:11:50,018
<i>Let me see now.</i>

136
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:53,156
<i>It is obvious that this
is no ordinary rabbit.</i>

137
00:11:53,158 --> 00:11:54,857
<i>Therefore, I must dream up</i>

138
00:11:54,859 --> 00:11:57,327
<i>a brilliant master strategy,
ingenious...</i>

139
00:11:57,329 --> 00:11:58,760
You okay, Doc?

140
00:11:58,762 --> 00:12:01,397
<i>Now, what if I lured him...</i>

141
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:03,466
<i>- Yeah, Mom. I'm okay.
- ...into a rock crusher?</i>

142
00:12:03,468 --> 00:12:05,801
<i>Nah, nah, nah,
too complicated.</i>

143
00:12:05,803 --> 00:12:09,872
<i>Yeah, yeah, too
complicated. But what if I...</i>

144
00:12:09,874 --> 00:12:11,373
<i>Too much detail.</i>

145
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:13,344
<i>Right.
Too much detail.</i>

146
00:12:32,795 --> 00:12:33,861
<i>And what's your name</i>

147
00:12:33,863 --> 00:12:35,230
- again, cutie?
- Dan.

148
00:12:35,232 --> 00:12:37,334
<i>Dan.</i>

149
00:13:12,502 --> 00:13:16,938
You're gonna take
your medicine.

150
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,005
Get off him.

151
00:13:18,007 --> 00:13:19,540
Get up. Get out of here.

152
00:13:19,542 --> 00:13:22,143
Shit.
I think you killed him.

153
00:13:22,145 --> 00:13:24,245
What if you killed him?

154
00:13:24,247 --> 00:13:25,912
I hope you killed him.

155
00:13:25,914 --> 00:13:27,450
You hear me?

156
00:13:29,152 --> 00:13:30,486
Let me kiss it better.

157
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:41,962
No, no, no.

158
00:13:41,964 --> 00:13:44,397
No, no, no.

159
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,867
Whoa. What the... No.

160
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:13,195
Mommy?

161
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:24,404
- Mommy?
- Baby.

162
00:14:24,406 --> 00:14:26,807
Here, here.

163
00:14:33,047 --> 00:14:36,081
<i>You can
put her money back, Doc.</i>

164
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:38,417
<i>You can do that much.</i>

165
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:40,452
She took mine.

166
00:14:40,454 --> 00:14:42,790
She probably bought
the coke with it.

167
00:14:43,491 --> 00:14:44,959

<i>...before he'll let

00:15:29,235 --> 00:15:30,501
<i>This sort of takes the
sting out of being occupied.</i>

179
00:15:30,503 --> 00:15:32,303
You're prettier
than your picture.

180
00:15:32,305 --> 00:15:33,338
<i>- Doesn't it, Mr. Richard?
- You said it.</i>

181
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:35,475
And you're older than yours.

182
00:15:37,377 --> 00:15:41,381
Are we staying here
or going somewhere?

183
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:45,884
Don't you wanna
watch the movie?

184
00:15:58,931 --> 00:16:00,631
I don't see
what the fuss is about.

185
00:16:00,633 --> 00:16:02,065
Chat room romance.

186
00:16:02,067 --> 00:16:04,535
Little gross. Not interesting.

187
00:16:04,537 --> 00:16:07,538
Just watch.
It's interesting, I promise.

188
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,639
Well, it better be,

189
00:16:08,641 --> 00:16:10,541
'cause she's not
all that steamy.

190
00:16:10,543 --> 00:16:13,477
And there she goes.

191
00:16:13,479 --> 00:16:15,481
Aren't you tired?

192
00:16:16,716 --> 00:16:18,484
Sleep.

193
00:16:29,561 --> 00:16:31,497
Okay.

194
00:16:37,969 --> 00:16:40,737
Wait. This is the best part.

195
00:16:40,739 --> 00:16:42,439
I watched her do it
three times now

196
00:16:42,441 --> 00:16:43,442
and it never gets old.

197
00:16:45,277 --> 00:16:47,143
Sleep deeper,

198
00:16:47,145 --> 00:16:50,045
deep as you can.

199
00:16:50,047 --> 00:16:53,384
The pain you feel
is only a dream.

200
00:16:55,654 --> 00:16:59,689
You can explain
a lost wallet

201
00:16:59,691 --> 00:17:02,626
when your wife asks.

202
00:17:02,628 --> 00:17:05,296
But you can't explain this.

203
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:08,030
This you'll see

204
00:17:08,032 --> 00:17:11,300
every day
when you look in the mirror.

205
00:17:11,302 --> 00:17:13,769
And every time you see it,

206
00:17:13,771 --> 00:17:16,607
you'll say out loud...

207
00:17:17,508 --> 00:17:19,477
"I like little girls."

208
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:25,181
And the next time
you go looking

209
00:17:25,183 --> 00:17:27,316
for a little girl online,

210
00:17:27,318 --> 00:17:30,486
I want you to remember
that time

211
00:17:30,488 --> 00:17:34,024
you got bitten
by a rattlesnake.

212
00:17:41,699 --> 00:17:43,668
- That is interesting.
- Mmm-hmm.

213
00:17:53,276 --> 00:17:55,543
Excuse me, miss?

214
00:17:55,545 --> 00:17:58,346
Miss. Miss, you left something
in the theater.

215
00:17:58,348 --> 00:17:59,382
You wanna leave me alone.

216
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:09,526
Well, hi there.

217
00:18:10,393 --> 00:18:11,994
You wanna let me go.

218
00:18:13,497 --> 00:18:15,665
Oh, no, sweetie.

219
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,034
No, I don't.

220
00:19:07,516 --> 00:19:10,182
Mommy, I made this for you.
It's a secret card.

221
00:19:10,184 --> 00:19:12,352
Thank you, Abba-doo.

222
00:19:12,354 --> 00:19:15,223
Does anyone know a magic word?

223
00:19:15,724 --> 00:19:18,725
Hmm. You.

224
00:19:18,727 --> 00:19:20,326
Abracadabra.

225
00:19:20,328 --> 00:19:22,161
Abracadabra.
That's a great one.

226
00:19:22,163 --> 00:19:25,131
- One, two, three.
- Two, three.

227
00:19:25,133 --> 00:19:28,601
Abracadabra.

228
00:19:28,603 --> 00:19:30,503
I know magic, too.

229
00:19:30,505 --> 00:19:32,171
Sometimes, if I...

230
00:19:33,341 --> 00:19:35,508
Sorry.

231
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:37,810
Has anyone seen my spoons?

232
00:19:37,812 --> 00:19:39,579
I can do that.

233
00:19:39,581 --> 00:19:41,380
That's nice, sweetie.

234
00:19:41,382 --> 00:19:42,450
- They're on you!
- Oh, they're on me?

235
00:19:48,456 --> 00:19:50,158
What the hell?

236
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,568
Dave...

237
00:20:13,547 --> 00:20:14,849
Abracadabra.

238
00:20:51,752 --> 00:20:52,851
Oops.

239
00:20:52,853 --> 00:20:54,919
Well, hi there, sleepyhead.

240
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:56,655
Sorry.

241
00:20:56,657 --> 00:20:59,223
I had to sleep you
pretty hard.

242
00:20:59,225 --> 00:21:00,992
You're a tough one.

243
00:21:00,994 --> 00:21:02,594
Willful.

244
00:21:02,596 --> 00:21:04,461
You know, I checked.

245
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:06,998
Six men in three months

246
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,401
with those little snakebite
tattoos on their cheeks.

247
00:21:10,403 --> 00:21:12,371
Why, you've been busy.

248
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:22,746
Snakebite Andi,
that's who you are.

249
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:25,184
So, who am I?

250
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:30,387
You're some crazy bitch
who kidnapped me.

251
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:31,989
Just the truth from now on.

252
00:21:31,991 --> 00:21:34,460
You will only speak the truth.

253
00:21:36,829 --> 00:21:40,296
You're the most beautiful
woman I've ever seen.

254
00:21:40,298 --> 00:21:41,632
My God.

255
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:44,001
Works a little too well,
don't it?

256
00:21:44,003 --> 00:21:46,870
Here's the deal,
Snakebite Andi.

257
00:21:46,872 --> 00:21:50,607
You're a pusher. Hmm?
You can push people.

258
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:53,877
We haven't had a pusher
around here for a little while

259
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:56,379
so I'm gonna offer you a deal
I haven't offered anyone

260
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:59,482
in almost 40 years.

261
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:02,287
How old are you, darlin'?

262
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:04,620
Fifteen.

263
00:22:04,622 --> 00:22:06,456
Fifteen?

264
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:09,692
Oh, God, what an age.

265
00:22:09,694 --> 00:22:12,795
Springtime of your womanhood,
isn't it?

266
00:22:12,797 --> 00:22:13,996
Mmm.

267
00:22:13,998 --> 00:22:15,798
You're not a girl anymore,

268
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:19,569
but you don't have
a single dent yet either.

269
00:22:19,571 --> 00:22:22,605
Gravity hasn't even
noticed you.

270
00:22:22,607 --> 00:22:24,509
Not at 15.

271
00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:27,244
Men, though...

272
00:22:28,446 --> 00:22:29,914
No, no, no. No shame.

273
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:35,818
You paid that back,
didn't you?

274
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:39,622
That's what I'm offering you.
Springtime forever.

275
00:22:39,624 --> 00:22:41,858
Ten years from now,
you're still 15.

276
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,428
A hundred, maybe 17.

277
00:22:45,964 --> 00:22:47,596
Eat well,

278
00:22:47,598 --> 00:22:51,936
stay young, live long.

279
00:24:01,671 --> 00:24:03,437
You like it?

280
00:24:03,439 --> 00:24:04,972
Oh. Sorry. I was just...

281
00:24:04,974 --> 00:24:08,408
That's okay.
People love to look at it.

282
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:10,511
We used to set this up
in the library.

283
00:24:10,513 --> 00:24:13,714
Community project, just taking
a life all its own.

284
00:24:13,716 --> 00:24:15,883
See, we started with
the clock tower there.

285
00:24:15,885 --> 00:24:17,720
- Oh, yeah.
- Just keeps growing.

286
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:19,887
Kids call it Teenytown.

287
00:24:19,889 --> 00:24:21,521
The kids build this?

288
00:24:21,523 --> 00:24:22,990
With some help, oh, yeah.

289
00:24:22,992 --> 00:24:25,862
Keep it up,
build the whole town square.

290
00:24:27,729 --> 00:24:31,831
Are you off the bus
or riding your thumb?

291
00:24:31,833 --> 00:24:33,167
Yeah, the bus.

292
00:24:33,169 --> 00:24:35,869
Oh. Not many ride the bus
this far north.

293
00:24:35,871 --> 00:24:39,074
Unless they're looking
for work.

294
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:42,878
Yeah.

295
00:24:43,945 --> 00:24:45,979
Change of scenery,

296
00:24:45,981 --> 00:24:48,550
or you running away
from something?

297
00:24:50,018 --> 00:24:51,784
Don't mind me.
I hope I'm...

298
00:24:51,786 --> 00:24:52,919
New face is all.

299
00:24:52,921 --> 00:24:54,554
Yeah.

300
00:24:54,556 --> 00:24:57,559
Guess I'm running away
from myself, I guess.

301
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:00,927
Oh, yeah.

302
00:25:00,929 --> 00:25:04,764
Running away from yourself.
That is a pickle.

303
00:25:04,766 --> 00:25:07,566
You take yourself
with you wherever you go.

304
00:25:07,568 --> 00:25:11,536
- Ain't that the bitch?
- Mmm-hmm.

305
00:25:11,538 --> 00:25:12,872
<i>Rent's 85 a week,</i>

306
00:25:12,874 --> 00:25:14,240
payable up front.

307
00:25:14,242 --> 00:25:17,743
Billy paid your first two,
rest's on you.

308
00:25:17,745 --> 00:25:21,613
No pets, no parties, no noise.

309
00:25:21,615 --> 00:25:24,083
I'm a quiet tenant.

310
00:25:24,085 --> 00:25:28,221
Last guy said the same.
Math student.

311
00:25:28,223 --> 00:25:30,122
Even let him paint the wall
all blackboard,

312
00:25:30,124 --> 00:25:33,191
so he could scribble his
little puzzles up there.

313
00:25:33,193 --> 00:25:36,028
Wasn't quiet. No, sir.

314
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:37,996
Didn't even paint over this
when he left,

315
00:25:37,998 --> 00:25:39,531
but I'm glad he didn't

316
00:25:39,533 --> 00:25:41,900
'cause I can make this easy
for ya,

317
00:25:41,902 --> 00:25:43,904
so you see it every morning
when you wake.

318
00:25:47,274 --> 00:25:49,174
You sure you wanna vouch
for this pup?

319
00:25:49,176 --> 00:25:50,709
Pretty sure.

320
00:25:50,711 --> 00:25:52,079
It's your ass, Billy.

321
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,049
Bleedin' heart, this one.

322
00:25:57,650 --> 00:26:01,019
I'm downstairs, ground floor,
if you need anything.

323
00:26:01,021 --> 00:26:03,756
Find me tomorrow,
talk about some work.

324
00:26:05,092 --> 00:26:07,292
Why are you doing this?

325
00:26:07,294 --> 00:26:08,926
You don't know me.

326
00:26:08,928 --> 00:26:10,861
No, I don't.

327
00:26:10,863 --> 00:26:13,698
But I know the look,
like I said.

328
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:17,235
And sometimes I get
this feeling about people.

329
00:26:17,237 --> 00:26:19,038
Hard to understand, I guess.

330
00:26:20,139 --> 00:26:22,008
Easier than you think.

331
00:26:23,609 --> 00:26:25,211
- Thanks.
- All right.

332
00:26:46,565 --> 00:26:47,800
You ready?

333
00:26:50,269 --> 00:26:51,703
She's ready.

334
00:26:56,908 --> 00:26:58,242
Who are these people?

335
00:26:58,244 --> 00:27:00,944
You'll find out after.

336
00:27:00,946 --> 00:27:02,879
That over there
is Grampa Flick,

337
00:27:02,881 --> 00:27:04,950
and he'll lead us.
Lie down.

338
00:27:05,617 --> 00:27:07,019
There.

339
00:27:11,189 --> 00:27:15,025
No fear.
You understand?

340
00:27:23,101 --> 00:27:25,802
We are the True Knot

341
00:27:25,804 --> 00:27:27,937
and we endure.

342
00:27:30,175 --> 00:27:32,275
We are the chosen ones.

343
00:27:34,346 --> 00:27:37,646
We are the fortunate ones.

344
00:27:40,252 --> 00:27:44,789
What is tied cannot be untied.

345
00:27:47,392 --> 00:27:50,126
Here is a woman.

346
00:27:50,128 --> 00:27:51,929
Would she join us?

347
00:27:53,764 --> 00:27:58,901
Would she tie
her life to our life?

348
00:27:58,903 --> 00:28:00,002
Yes.

349
00:28:00,004 --> 00:28:01,703
Yes.

350
00:28:01,705 --> 00:28:04,708
Say yes.

351
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:07,178
Yes.

352
00:28:08,813 --> 00:28:11,747
This one's special.

353
00:28:11,749 --> 00:28:13,282
Her name's Violet.

354
00:28:13,284 --> 00:28:15,019
There's not much of her left.

355
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:18,655
And she tastes...

356
00:28:19,924 --> 00:28:22,827
like flowers.

357
00:28:44,248 --> 00:28:46,348
Breathe deep.

358
00:28:54,257 --> 00:28:57,861
There. Embrace it.

359
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:02,632
Embrace it.

360
00:29:12,275 --> 00:29:15,078
No!

361
00:29:16,879 --> 00:29:20,081
No! No!

362
00:30:06,495 --> 00:30:09,131
They haven't found us yet.

363
00:30:11,033 --> 00:30:13,200
They were used to
hearing him cry

364
00:30:13,202 --> 00:30:15,836
'cause I left him alone
so much.

365
00:30:18,407 --> 00:30:20,309
So they didn't do anything.

366
00:30:23,312 --> 00:30:26,178
And they haven't found us yet.

367
00:30:33,421 --> 00:30:35,122
Mommy?

368
00:30:55,343 --> 00:30:57,576
Oh, hey.

369
00:30:57,578 --> 00:31:01,012
Uh, you said
that you knew my look.

370
00:31:01,014 --> 00:31:02,749
Well, what did you mean?

371
00:31:04,084 --> 00:31:06,084
You're sick.

372
00:31:06,086 --> 00:31:08,389
You're tired.
I can see that much.

373
00:31:10,458 --> 00:31:12,158
I need help.

374
00:31:16,029 --> 00:31:17,862
Come on in.

375
00:31:17,864 --> 00:31:19,266
We'll talk about it.

376
00:31:22,369 --> 00:31:24,435
<i>God, grant me the serenity</i>

377
00:31:24,437 --> 00:31:27,305
<i>to accept the things
I cannot change,</i>

378
00:31:27,307 --> 00:31:29,540
the courage
to change the things I can

379
00:31:29,542 --> 00:31:32,377
and the wisdom
to know the difference.

380
00:31:32,379 --> 00:31:34,345
Well, Bobbie's got
a big birthday today.

381
00:31:34,347 --> 00:31:35,947
Three years.
Three years sober.

382
00:31:35,949 --> 00:31:37,250
Yeah.

383
00:31:39,286 --> 00:31:41,052
Thanks, John.

384
00:31:41,054 --> 00:31:42,886
Well, now for the most
important person in the room.

385
00:31:42,888 --> 00:31:45,791
Is, uh, anybody here a newbie?

386
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:49,795
Somebody got 24 hours?

387
00:31:52,365 --> 00:31:53,366
Yeah.

388
00:32:01,206 --> 00:32:02,873
<i>New to town, huh?</i>

389
00:32:02,875 --> 00:32:04,274
Yeah, I, uh...

390
00:32:04,276 --> 00:32:05,643
Nothing personal.

391
00:32:05,645 --> 00:32:07,077
I delivered half the people
in the room.

392
00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:08,078
Just new faces pop,
that's all.

393
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,212
This here is Dan Torrance.

394
00:32:09,214 --> 00:32:11,114
- He's fresh off the bus.
- Oh, hey.

395
00:32:11,116 --> 00:32:13,552
Fresh off the ground,
by the look.

396
00:32:14,253 --> 00:32:15,452
Oh.

397
00:32:15,454 --> 00:32:17,421
There's no judgment here,
brother.

398
00:32:17,423 --> 00:32:18,922
I mean, we've all been there.

399
00:32:18,924 --> 00:32:20,924
- And worse, trust me.
- Oh, yeah.

400
00:32:20,926 --> 00:32:23,193
If you're looking
for a wing to climb under,

401
00:32:23,195 --> 00:32:24,361
I can't say
you'll do any better

402
00:32:24,363 --> 00:32:26,330
than Billy Freeman here.

403
00:32:26,332 --> 00:32:28,866
Thank you
for your hospitality. I...

404
00:32:29,568 --> 00:32:32,202
I'm a little, uh...

405
00:32:32,204 --> 00:32:34,237
I guess I'm not used to it.

406
00:32:34,239 --> 00:32:36,106
Well, you know we say,

407
00:32:36,108 --> 00:32:37,674
"You can't judge someone till
you know their whole story."

408
00:32:37,676 --> 00:32:39,209
You might think
you understand,

409
00:32:39,211 --> 00:32:42,044
- but you don't.
- You don't.

410
00:32:42,046 --> 00:32:43,413
So, how are you today?
All right?

411
00:32:43,415 --> 00:32:44,947
Train's still running.

412
00:32:44,949 --> 00:32:46,949
That's good to hear.

413
00:32:46,951 --> 00:32:48,117
You good?

414
00:32:48,119 --> 00:32:50,420
Yeah. Yeah.

415
00:32:50,422 --> 00:32:51,688
Well, good to know you, Dan.

416
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:53,155
- Yeah.
- Come again.

417
00:32:53,157 --> 00:32:54,323
- Thanks.
- Hope to see you again soon.

418
00:32:54,325 --> 00:32:56,926
I'll come back, yeah.

419
00:32:56,928 --> 00:32:59,596
Really good man.
He's got a gift...

420
00:32:59,598 --> 00:33:01,430
Yeah. Hey, Billy, hang on.

421
00:33:01,432 --> 00:33:03,201
Hey, Doc.

422
00:33:04,703 --> 00:33:07,570
Your watch. Uh...

423
00:33:07,572 --> 00:33:10,673
You lost your watch. You were
worried about the kid with...

424
00:33:10,675 --> 00:33:12,577
Goocher's.

425
00:33:14,178 --> 00:33:15,945
What?

426
00:33:15,947 --> 00:33:20,017
The kid with Goocher's
or Gaucher's. The bone thing.

427
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,387
Gaucher's disease.

428
00:33:24,389 --> 00:33:26,155
Right.

429
00:33:26,157 --> 00:33:27,490
You were washing your hands
in the hospital bathroom

430
00:33:27,492 --> 00:33:29,227
and you left it
on the soap dispenser.

431
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:35,063
Well, just check
on the soap dispenser.

432
00:33:35,065 --> 00:33:37,200
- It's good to meet you.
- Yeah.

433
00:33:42,305 --> 00:33:43,907
How did you know?

434
00:33:45,108 --> 00:33:47,177
I wish I could say. Uh...

435
00:33:48,546 --> 00:33:50,180
Lucky guess.

436
00:33:53,049 --> 00:33:54,384
My ass.

437
00:33:55,318 --> 00:33:57,051
Intuition, I suppose.

438
00:33:57,053 --> 00:33:59,256
Like a feeling in my gut.
Maybe a...

439
00:34:01,057 --> 00:34:03,057
A lucky guess.

440
00:34:03,059 --> 00:34:04,961
What do you wanna do here?

441
00:34:06,229 --> 00:34:07,562
What do you mean?

442
00:34:07,564 --> 00:34:10,467
I mean here in Frazier.
Why are you here?

443
00:34:12,436 --> 00:34:14,469
I don't know. I don't know.

444
00:34:14,471 --> 00:34:18,073
Something different
than I've been doing.

445
00:34:19,443 --> 00:34:21,311
Something better.

446
00:34:24,581 --> 00:34:26,349
You go to church?

447
00:34:27,149 --> 00:34:28,516
Does it matter?

448
00:34:28,518 --> 00:34:30,554
Do you believe in something?
Something...

449
00:34:32,354 --> 00:34:34,123
bigger than you?

450
00:34:36,058 --> 00:34:39,259
Our beliefs
don't make us better people.

451
00:34:39,261 --> 00:34:41,630
Our actions
make us better people.

452
00:34:44,066 --> 00:34:46,400
So, Billy says
you have orderly experience.

453
00:34:46,402 --> 00:34:48,135
That's right.

454
00:34:48,137 --> 00:34:49,670
You workin' right now?

455
00:34:49,672 --> 00:34:53,307
A few shifts at Teenytown.
Helping with the train.

456
00:34:53,309 --> 00:34:54,541
'Cause I do three days a week

457
00:34:54,543 --> 00:34:56,677
at Rivington House,
the hospice.

458
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:58,779
Good orderly is tough to find.

459
00:34:58,781 --> 00:35:00,216
Tougher to keep.

460
00:35:01,484 --> 00:35:03,650
Do dying people bother you?

461
00:35:03,652 --> 00:35:05,419
No.

462
00:35:05,421 --> 00:35:07,053
We're all dying.

463
00:35:07,055 --> 00:35:10,156
The world is one big hospice
with fresh air.

464
00:35:10,158 --> 00:35:11,393
Hmm.

465
00:35:53,701 --> 00:35:54,702
Wow.

466
00:35:55,637 --> 00:35:58,105
Well, hi there.

467
00:35:59,106 --> 00:36:00,575
You said it didn't hurt.

468
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:05,811
Doesn't now, does it?

469
00:36:05,813 --> 00:36:07,649
Felt like I was dying.

470
00:36:09,116 --> 00:36:10,348
I know.

471
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:11,686
You did.

472
00:36:12,887 --> 00:36:14,854
You'll feel better
when you eat.

473
00:36:14,856 --> 00:36:16,590
Am I still human?

474
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:20,227
Do you care?

475
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:50,089
Hey. Let him be.

476
00:36:51,758 --> 00:36:53,794
Azreel, leave him be.

477
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:05,538
Azzie?

478
00:37:06,606 --> 00:37:07,808
Azzie, come on.

479
00:37:08,742 --> 00:37:11,642
Come on. Azzie.

480
00:37:11,644 --> 00:37:12,813
Doc.

481
00:37:13,779 --> 00:37:15,779
That you, Doc?

482
00:37:15,781 --> 00:37:17,481
No, I'm not a doctor.

483
00:37:17,483 --> 00:37:19,683
Do you want me
to get you a doctor?

484
00:37:19,685 --> 00:37:21,251
The cat's on my bed.

485
00:37:21,253 --> 00:37:22,720
Oh, hey, I'll move her.

486
00:37:22,722 --> 00:37:24,221
No.

487
00:37:24,223 --> 00:37:26,490
I knew she would be.

488
00:37:26,492 --> 00:37:30,596
That cat
always seems to know...

489
00:37:32,465 --> 00:37:34,199
when it's time.

490
00:37:35,735 --> 00:37:38,402
- I guess it's time.
- No.

491
00:37:38,404 --> 00:37:40,938
It's just Azzie
being a silly old cat.

492
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:43,272
Nope.

493
00:37:43,274 --> 00:37:45,678
Been that way
ever since I got here.

494
00:37:46,846 --> 00:37:48,746
The cat knows

495
00:37:48,748 --> 00:37:51,214
when it's time to go to sleep.

496
00:37:51,216 --> 00:37:53,318
Everybody knows that.

497
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,822
I'm gonna die.

498
00:38:07,365 --> 00:38:09,599
Yes.

499
00:38:09,601 --> 00:38:10,767
Let me get you someone.

500
00:38:10,769 --> 00:38:12,138
No.

501
00:38:13,772 --> 00:38:16,708
Known it was comin'.

502
00:38:18,643 --> 00:38:20,843
Doesn't make it less scary.

503
00:38:20,845 --> 00:38:22,578
Yeah.

504
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:24,781
But maybe
it's just like you say,

505
00:38:24,783 --> 00:38:27,717
just going to sleep.

506
00:38:27,719 --> 00:38:31,554
I mean, there's nothing scary.
It's just sleeping.

507
00:38:31,556 --> 00:38:33,723
You're a strange
type of doctor.

508
00:38:33,725 --> 00:38:35,625
I told you, I'm not a doctor.

509
00:38:35,627 --> 00:38:37,494
Oh, I think you are.

510
00:38:38,395 --> 00:38:40,462
Doctor Sleep.

511
00:38:40,464 --> 00:38:44,000
Doc, I am so scared
it's gonna hurt, or be dark,

512
00:38:44,002 --> 00:38:46,869
or be nothing at all.
And I don't wanna...

513
00:38:46,871 --> 00:38:48,873
<i>Nothing to be scared of.</i>

514
00:38:49,807 --> 00:38:52,841
<i>Just going to sleep.</i>

515
00:38:52,843 --> 00:38:57,548
<i>Finally, true, restful sleep.</i>

516
00:39:01,685 --> 00:39:03,320
Oh, thank you.

517
00:39:04,455 --> 00:39:07,723
Thank you, Doc.

518
00:39:07,725 --> 00:39:10,459
Look, I shouldn't be here.
Let me go get you some...

519
00:39:10,461 --> 00:39:11,793
No, no, no.

520
00:39:11,795 --> 00:39:15,699
You're exactly
where you should be.

521
00:39:17,868 --> 00:39:19,536
Exactly.

522
00:39:23,807 --> 00:39:26,474
I see my wife.

523
00:41:02,637 --> 00:41:04,570
Dan, alcoholic.

524
00:41:04,572 --> 00:41:06,172
Hi, Dan.

525
00:41:06,174 --> 00:41:08,741
I'm not much of a speech guy.

526
00:41:08,743 --> 00:41:10,009
I just thought
I'd hold the chip

527
00:41:10,011 --> 00:41:12,613
and talk about
whatever popped up.

528
00:41:13,747 --> 00:41:15,951
And I'm thinkin' about my dad.

529
00:41:17,185 --> 00:41:18,717
He died when I was five,

530
00:41:18,719 --> 00:41:20,786
so the only way
I got to know him,

531
00:41:20,788 --> 00:41:24,990
really got to know him,
was when I went dark.

532
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:28,863
When I drank to dull the,

533
00:41:29,697 --> 00:41:31,763
or, uh,

534
00:41:31,765 --> 00:41:34,132
whenever I wanted
to break someone's face,

535
00:41:34,134 --> 00:41:36,768
'cause the drinking

536
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:39,037
and the temper and the anger,

537
00:41:39,039 --> 00:41:40,873
those things in me were his.

538
00:41:40,875 --> 00:41:42,877
And they were
all I could know of him.

539
00:41:45,713 --> 00:41:51,216
But now, well, now I get to
know him a little different,

540
00:41:51,218 --> 00:41:54,887
'cause he also stood
in a room like this once

541
00:41:54,889 --> 00:41:59,559
wanting to get well
for me and my mom.

542
00:42:01,128 --> 00:42:03,628
And he held the chip
in his hand,

543
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:05,931
and the chip said five months

544
00:42:05,933 --> 00:42:08,633
and on that day, he...

545
00:42:08,635 --> 00:42:10,403
Before it all...

546
00:42:12,572 --> 00:42:14,605
Well, on that day,
all he wanted in the world

547
00:42:14,607 --> 00:42:16,743
was to stand
where I'm standing now.

548
00:42:17,944 --> 00:42:19,879
And here I am,

549
00:42:21,547 --> 00:42:24,183
so thank you for us both,
I guess.

550
00:42:25,218 --> 00:42:27,184
This is for Jack Torrance.

551
00:42:43,803 --> 00:42:44,871
Hey, Charlie.

552
00:42:48,607 --> 00:42:49,608
Doc?

553
00:42:52,611 --> 00:42:58,215
Guess I don't need to ask
why you're here at this hour.

554
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:02,186
Do you have pain?

555
00:43:02,188 --> 00:43:04,756
Do you want me to get
Claudette to bring you a pill?

556
00:43:05,991 --> 00:43:07,893
Pill won't matter.

557
00:43:09,728 --> 00:43:13,797
I'm not scared of hell, Doc.

558
00:43:13,799 --> 00:43:18,535
I lived a decent life.

559
00:43:18,537 --> 00:43:21,705
I don't think there is
such a place anyway.

560
00:43:21,707 --> 00:43:23,608
I guess I'm scared...

561
00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:28,544
there's nothing.

562
00:43:28,546 --> 00:43:30,581
We don't end, Charlie.

563
00:43:31,316 --> 00:43:33,649
I know that for certain.

564
00:43:33,651 --> 00:43:35,619
I don't know much else,

565
00:43:36,822 --> 00:43:39,157
but I know that we don't end.

566
00:43:41,259 --> 00:43:43,059
Blueberries.

567
00:43:43,061 --> 00:43:48,964
I can taste blueberries
my mother used to grow.

568
00:43:48,966 --> 00:43:50,799
Can you taste them?

569
00:43:50,801 --> 00:43:52,770
Yeah, I can.

570
00:43:54,672 --> 00:43:57,740
And I can hear Frank
on your old radio.

571
00:43:57,742 --> 00:43:59,208
The one you used to have
on your workbench

572
00:43:59,210 --> 00:44:02,044
next to your tools.

573
00:44:02,046 --> 00:44:04,346

574
00:44:04,348 --> 00:44:08,250

580
00:44:35,379 --> 00:44:38,182
Been a minute, little pen pal.

581
00:44:51,628 --> 00:44:56,164
Abra? School.

582
00:44:56,166 --> 00:44:58,301
Fine, I know.

583
00:45:16,718 --> 00:45:18,885
Hey, Gramps, you seen Rosie?

584
00:45:18,887 --> 00:45:20,823
Watchtower.

585
00:45:22,791 --> 00:45:24,825
You feelin' okay?

586
00:45:24,827 --> 00:45:27,060
Peachy keen.

587
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:46,782
Hey.

588
00:45:48,117 --> 00:45:49,816
Sorry to interrupt.

589
00:45:49,818 --> 00:45:51,952
Any luck?

590
00:45:51,954 --> 00:45:54,020
- Gettin' closer.
- Hmm.

591
00:45:54,022 --> 00:45:56,857
He's somewhere in Iowa,
I think.

592
00:45:56,859 --> 00:45:58,925
We'll all take
a nice long road trip

593
00:45:58,927 --> 00:46:00,829
once I'm sure I've found him.

594
00:46:03,698 --> 00:46:05,831
Until I do, we...

595
00:46:05,833 --> 00:46:08,801
You gotta open
a canister, Rosie.

596
00:46:08,803 --> 00:46:10,403
We took steam
six months ago, Crow.

597
00:46:10,405 --> 00:46:12,405
Six months is nothing.

598
00:46:12,407 --> 00:46:14,807
That kid in Delaware
wasn't so steamy

599
00:46:14,809 --> 00:46:16,376
and it's already showing.

600
00:46:16,378 --> 00:46:18,345
You see
Grampa Flick's hair, yeah?

601
00:46:18,347 --> 00:46:19,812
Yeah.

602
00:46:19,814 --> 00:46:21,381
I don't think he's well.

603
00:46:21,383 --> 00:46:24,083
Grampa Flick hasn't been well
since Nixon was in office.

604
00:46:24,085 --> 00:46:26,285
I know.

605
00:46:26,287 --> 00:46:29,257
But we need to eat.
All of us.

606
00:46:30,758 --> 00:46:32,791
Are the canisters low?

607
00:46:32,793 --> 00:46:34,326
Course not.

608
00:46:34,328 --> 00:46:37,765
Just no need to waste one
if you're close to the kill.

609
00:46:39,233 --> 00:46:40,766
- Rosie.
- Mmm-hmm?

610
00:46:40,768 --> 00:46:43,271
I might need it
just to find him.

611
00:46:47,074 --> 00:46:48,807
There used to be more steam
in the world, you know?

612
00:46:48,809 --> 00:46:50,476
Oh, don't be daft. Come on.

613
00:46:50,478 --> 00:46:52,211
That's like when rubes say,

614
00:46:52,213 --> 00:46:54,413
"50 years ago, people used to
be more neighborly."

615
00:46:54,415 --> 00:46:56,182
But it's true, Rosie.

616
00:46:56,184 --> 00:46:58,184
There's less steam out there,
and it's weaker, too.

617
00:46:58,186 --> 00:47:00,186
I don't know if it's their
cell phones or diets,

618
00:47:00,188 --> 00:47:01,853
or their Netflix or what,

619
00:47:01,855 --> 00:47:03,988
but I am not picking up
many scents these days

620
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:05,524
and the ones that I do, Rosie,
are just not that...

621
00:47:05,526 --> 00:47:07,859
I'll open a canister tonight
to tide everyone over.

622
00:47:07,861 --> 00:47:09,397
Thank you.

623
00:47:15,403 --> 00:47:17,902
- You know it, Rosie.
- I know what?

624
00:47:17,904 --> 00:47:19,170
It's why
you're up here every day.

625
00:47:19,172 --> 00:47:20,405
It's why you're always up here

626
00:47:20,407 --> 00:47:21,975
no matter
what you tell the others.

627
00:47:22,976 --> 00:47:24,375
The world's not as steamy

628
00:47:24,377 --> 00:47:26,479
and you are looking
for a whale.

629
00:48:15,127 --> 00:48:16,260
Oh, watch this kid.

630
00:48:16,262 --> 00:48:17,861
Number 19.

631
00:48:17,863 --> 00:48:19,596
That kid is a natural.

632
00:48:19,598 --> 00:48:21,565
He hits the ball every time.

633
00:48:21,567 --> 00:48:24,101
Like he can read
the pitcher's mind.

634
00:48:24,103 --> 00:48:25,838
Hmm. Is that right?

635
00:48:33,878 --> 00:48:35,312
See? You watch,

636
00:48:35,314 --> 00:48:36,979
one of these days,
one of those talent scouts

637
00:48:36,981 --> 00:48:39,884
is gonna get wind of
Brad there. You watch.

638
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:04,140
Hey, 19,

639
00:49:04,142 --> 00:49:06,409
just saw your game.

640
00:49:06,411 --> 00:49:08,511
You are ready for the majors.

641
00:49:08,513 --> 00:49:10,413
- Well played.
- Thanks.

642
00:49:10,415 --> 00:49:12,248
Hey, you headin' home?

643
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:15,451
You wanna hop in?
I'll give you a ride.

644
00:49:15,453 --> 00:49:17,586
No, it's real close.

645
00:49:17,588 --> 00:49:18,889
I'm good.

646
00:49:21,326 --> 00:49:23,092
It's okay.

647
00:49:23,094 --> 00:49:24,460
We're friends.

648
00:49:24,462 --> 00:49:26,197
You wanna hop in.
We'll take you right home.

649
00:49:27,332 --> 00:49:29,167
You can take me right home.

650
00:49:30,168 --> 00:49:32,368
You trust me.

651
00:49:32,370 --> 00:49:33,970
I trust you.

652
00:50:08,638 --> 00:50:11,373
No! No, please! No!

653
00:50:22,652 --> 00:50:24,686
No! Please let me go.

654
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:27,491
Please, I won't tell.
Please. Please!

655
00:50:30,126 --> 00:50:34,027
Number 19.

656
00:50:34,029 --> 00:50:35,530
Kid, you were good.

657
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:37,601
No!

658
00:50:42,304 --> 00:50:44,671
No, please let me go.

659
00:50:44,673 --> 00:50:46,173
I won't tell.

660
00:50:46,175 --> 00:50:47,975
I won't tell. Please.

661
00:50:47,977 --> 00:50:49,209
It's okay.

662
00:50:49,211 --> 00:50:50,346
Please.

663
00:50:53,616 --> 00:50:54,617
Ah.

664
00:50:58,721 --> 00:51:01,188
Are you gonna hurt me?

665
00:51:01,190 --> 00:51:02,322
Yes.

666
00:51:02,324 --> 00:51:04,226
No!

667
00:51:05,528 --> 00:51:08,027
Pain purifies steam.

668
00:51:08,029 --> 00:51:10,633
Fear, too, so, you understand.

669
00:51:30,552 --> 00:51:33,019
Shh.

670
00:52:03,317 --> 00:52:04,318
Stop.

671
00:52:05,285 --> 00:52:06,786
Stop.

672
00:52:06,788 --> 00:52:08,322
Stop!

673
00:52:10,090 --> 00:52:11,693
<i>Stop, monster.</i>

674
00:52:18,565 --> 00:52:20,300
<i>Stop. Stop.</i>

675
00:52:21,335 --> 00:52:22,503
What is it?

676
00:52:32,813 --> 00:52:35,380
No! Stop!

677
00:52:39,786 --> 00:52:41,353
Abra! Abra!

678
00:52:41,355 --> 00:52:43,087
Hey, hey, hey!

679
00:52:43,089 --> 00:52:44,556
Sweetie. Sweetheart, wake up.
Wake up, sweetheart.

680
00:52:44,558 --> 00:52:45,724
- Abra, wake up!
- Hey, hey, hey.

681
00:52:45,726 --> 00:52:47,260
- Abra! Abra!
- Stop it!

682
00:52:56,302 --> 00:52:57,303
Jesus.

683
00:53:42,715 --> 00:53:44,382
Okay.

684
00:53:44,850 --> 00:53:46,619
Okay.

685
00:53:47,385 --> 00:53:48,854
Okay.

686
00:54:51,281 --> 00:54:53,248
Okay, ready?

687
00:55:06,430 --> 00:55:08,830
They killed him.

688
00:55:08,832 --> 00:55:11,301
They killed him.

689
00:55:16,272 --> 00:55:17,941
- It's okay.
- It's all right.

690
00:55:29,419 --> 00:55:30,888
We had a looker.

691
00:55:35,625 --> 00:55:37,258
Tonight?

692
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:38,559
Mmm-hmm.

693
00:55:38,561 --> 00:55:40,394
Yeah.

694
00:55:40,396 --> 00:55:42,630
Big steam?

695
00:55:42,632 --> 00:55:44,834
Oh, honey, it was huge.

696
00:55:46,269 --> 00:55:47,568
Where?

697
00:55:47,570 --> 00:55:49,806
East Coast, I think.

698
00:55:52,608 --> 00:55:54,508
You're saying
someone looked in

699
00:55:54,510 --> 00:55:56,813
from 1,500 miles away?

700
00:55:58,281 --> 00:55:59,849
Maybe further.

701
00:56:01,751 --> 00:56:03,283
Boy or girl?

702
00:56:03,285 --> 00:56:04,952
Girl, I think.

703
00:56:04,954 --> 00:56:08,022
She was out of there so fast.

704
00:56:08,024 --> 00:56:11,025
But I swear, Crow Daddy,

705
00:56:11,027 --> 00:56:13,963
I haven't felt power
like that,

706
00:56:14,864 --> 00:56:17,466
raw power like that...

707
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:20,901
in so long.

708
00:56:20,903 --> 00:56:23,070
Then we need to look into it.

709
00:56:23,072 --> 00:56:25,305
- Sooner the better.
- Yeah.

710
00:56:25,307 --> 00:56:26,941
Case her parents freak out,

711
00:56:26,943 --> 00:56:29,576
send her to a psychiatrist.

712
00:56:29,578 --> 00:56:32,712
You know, they get her on
pills, could ruin the steam.

713
00:56:32,714 --> 00:56:33,847
Might muffle her just...

714
00:56:33,849 --> 00:56:35,515
No, giving Paxil to this kid,

715
00:56:35,517 --> 00:56:37,751
it's like throwing
a piece of Saran Wrap

716
00:56:37,753 --> 00:56:39,419
over a searchlight.

717
00:56:39,421 --> 00:56:41,788
I don't know where she is

718
00:56:41,790 --> 00:56:45,658
but when she comes back,
and she'll be back,

719
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:47,729
oh, I'll be ready, honey.

720
00:56:49,965 --> 00:56:51,666
I'll be ready.

721
00:57:52,592 --> 00:57:54,425
Morning.

722
00:57:54,427 --> 00:57:55,495
Morning.

723
00:57:56,997 --> 00:57:58,163
Guess what.

724
00:57:58,165 --> 00:58:00,165
I made a new friend.

725
00:58:00,167 --> 00:58:02,000
His name's Dan.

726
00:58:02,002 --> 00:58:04,136
Abs, are you okay?

727
00:58:04,138 --> 00:58:05,570
Last night, I...

728
00:58:05,572 --> 00:58:07,638
I'm okay.

729
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:09,141
Sorry about that.

730
00:58:09,143 --> 00:58:12,443
I know that head of yours
is like a radio sometimes.

731
00:58:12,445 --> 00:58:16,547
And you pick up
some weird stations.

732
00:58:16,549 --> 00:58:17,617
Nothing weird like that.

733
00:58:18,585 --> 00:58:20,587
Not anymore.

734
00:58:29,195 --> 00:58:30,862
<i>My God.</i>

735
00:58:30,864 --> 00:58:33,664
<i>I've gotta study.
If I don't study...</i>

736
00:58:33,666 --> 00:58:37,702
<i>Running play.
Hand-off to 11 and...</i>

737
00:58:37,704 --> 00:58:40,671
<i>Coach is gonna kill me
if I don't get these.</i>

738
00:58:40,673 --> 00:58:42,639
<i>Why doesn't he like me?</i>

739
00:58:42,641 --> 00:58:44,608
<i>My hair?
I should change my hair.</i>

740
00:58:44,610 --> 00:58:46,177
<i>The freak
is staring at me again.</i>

741
00:58:46,179 --> 00:58:48,012
<i>What is she staring at?</i>

742
00:58:48,014 --> 00:58:49,048
<i>Freak.</i>

743
00:59:28,854 --> 00:59:29,986
Hey, Abba-doo.

744
00:59:29,988 --> 00:59:31,221
Hey, Dad.

745
00:59:31,223 --> 00:59:33,656
School okay?

746
00:59:33,658 --> 00:59:35,225
How's the book?

747
00:59:35,227 --> 00:59:37,193
Good. Yeah, going good.

748
00:59:37,195 --> 00:59:39,197
I'm writing about
Charleston and Black Bottom.

749
00:59:40,665 --> 00:59:41,864
It's feeling like...

750
00:59:41,866 --> 00:59:43,866
I'm going to
start my homework.

751
00:59:43,868 --> 00:59:47,603
Okay. Good.
That's good, sweetie.

752
00:59:47,605 --> 00:59:49,772
Think Harvard in three years.

753
00:59:49,774 --> 00:59:50,973
We'll see.

754
00:59:50,975 --> 00:59:52,843
Yeah. We will see.

755
01:02:54,021 --> 01:02:55,988
<i>Thanks so much
for shopping with us today.</i>

756
01:02:55,990 --> 01:02:59,127
<i>And remember, we're
always fresh, just for you.</i>

757
01:03:28,421 --> 01:03:30,023
Well, hi there.

758
01:03:37,998 --> 01:03:39,232
Get out!

759
01:03:41,268 --> 01:03:43,170
Get out! Get out of my head!

760
01:03:45,038 --> 01:03:46,206
Get out!

761
01:03:55,814 --> 01:03:58,182
- Ma'am, are you okay?
- No! No.

762
01:03:58,184 --> 01:04:00,219
Yeah, I'm fine.

763
01:04:01,253 --> 01:04:02,853
I'm fine.

764
01:04:09,496 --> 01:04:12,196
Jesus.

765
01:04:12,198 --> 01:04:14,064
Danno?

766
01:04:14,066 --> 01:04:15,532
Dan? Dan?

767
01:04:15,534 --> 01:04:17,935
Get up. Stand up, Dan.

768
01:04:17,937 --> 01:04:19,171
Come on, Danno.

769
01:04:20,839 --> 01:04:23,140
- What happened?
- Well, you just dropped.

770
01:04:23,142 --> 01:04:25,911
Thought you was having
a stroke. Who's Tony?

771
01:04:27,213 --> 01:04:28,778
What?

772
01:04:28,780 --> 01:04:30,082
You kept saying,
"Please help me, Tony."

773
01:04:31,350 --> 01:04:33,350
Oh.

774
01:04:33,352 --> 01:04:35,987
Well, I'm sorry about that.

775
01:04:55,507 --> 01:04:57,475
Rosie?

776
01:05:08,853 --> 01:05:10,219
We've got a problem.

777
01:05:10,221 --> 01:05:11,356
- Talk to me.
- The looker?

778
01:05:12,490 --> 01:05:14,590
Yeah, she found me again.

779
01:05:14,592 --> 01:05:16,359
- How?
- I don't know.

780
01:05:16,361 --> 01:05:17,892
I don't care.

781
01:05:17,894 --> 01:05:21,130
We have to have her, Crow.
We have to.

782
01:05:21,132 --> 01:05:23,432
Does she know who you are?
Where we are?

783
01:05:23,434 --> 01:05:25,234
No, I don't know.
I don't think...

784
01:05:25,236 --> 01:05:26,803
That's not the important...
Look.

785
01:05:27,505 --> 01:05:29,138
I said she's huge steam,

786
01:05:29,140 --> 01:05:30,373
- right?
- Mmm-hmm.

787
01:05:30,375 --> 01:05:32,173
Yeah, it's even bigger
than that.

788
01:05:32,175 --> 01:05:33,842
I tried to turn around in her

789
01:05:33,844 --> 01:05:36,512
and she blew me out of her
like I was nothing.

790
01:05:36,514 --> 01:05:37,912
Bullshit.

791
01:05:37,914 --> 01:05:40,081
No. Never happened
to me, ever.

792
01:05:40,083 --> 01:05:41,885
I would have said
that was impossible.

793
01:05:43,454 --> 01:05:45,922
Is she food,
or do we turn her?

794
01:05:46,557 --> 01:05:48,290
We don't turn her.

795
01:05:48,292 --> 01:05:49,858
Rosie, are you sure?

796
01:05:49,860 --> 01:05:51,393
If she's what you say
she is, then...

797
01:05:51,395 --> 01:05:54,462
Then we don't want anyone
with that power in the Knot.

798
01:05:54,464 --> 01:05:56,466
Jeez. Think about it.

799
01:06:01,571 --> 01:06:03,071
Have a great day.

800
01:06:03,073 --> 01:06:04,807
You, too.

801
01:07:22,718 --> 01:07:24,452
<i>Hi.</i>

802
01:07:34,629 --> 01:07:36,398
Billy.

803
01:07:54,382 --> 01:07:56,081
<i>You can hear me.</i>

804
01:07:56,083 --> 01:07:58,653
Let's use our outside voices,
all right?

805
01:07:59,687 --> 01:08:01,454
You tracked me down?

806
01:08:01,456 --> 01:08:05,290
It was easier than I thought.
Like GPS, but in my head.

807
01:08:05,292 --> 01:08:06,626
Look, I don't mean
any offense,

808
01:08:06,628 --> 01:08:10,295
but this day and age,
a grown man

809
01:08:10,297 --> 01:08:12,197
sitting with a teenage girl
on a park bench...

810
01:08:12,199 --> 01:08:13,498
I'm Abra Stone.

811
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:15,200
And if anyone asks,
you're my uncle.

812
01:08:15,202 --> 01:08:17,137
Uncle Dan.

813
01:08:19,239 --> 01:08:22,507
And that's not even a lie.
Not totally.

814
01:08:22,509 --> 01:08:24,545
You're magic, like me.

815
01:08:26,180 --> 01:08:28,348
I don't know about magic.

816
01:08:29,116 --> 01:08:30,415
I...

817
01:08:30,417 --> 01:08:32,250
I always called it
the shining.

818
01:08:32,252 --> 01:08:35,053
And, yeah, we both shine.

819
01:08:35,055 --> 01:08:36,521
Do your parents know?

820
01:08:36,523 --> 01:08:39,291
About my shine?

821
01:08:39,293 --> 01:08:41,493
They don't talk about it.

822
01:08:41,495 --> 01:08:45,029
Or if I use it,
they look at me different.

823
01:08:45,031 --> 01:08:47,432
When I was a kid, I didn't
understand the shining.

824
01:08:47,434 --> 01:08:49,334
I called it "Tony."

825
01:08:49,336 --> 01:08:51,670
I thought he was
my imaginary friend.

826
01:08:51,672 --> 01:08:54,739
I thought you were
my imaginary friend...

827
01:08:54,741 --> 01:08:57,043
for a long time.

828
01:08:58,211 --> 01:09:01,580
How many of us are out there?

829
01:09:01,582 --> 01:09:03,615
There's a lot of people who
have a little bit of shine,

830
01:09:03,617 --> 01:09:05,316
they don't even know it.

831
01:09:05,318 --> 01:09:06,718
They always seem
to come home with flowers

832
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:08,586
when their wives are sad,

833
01:09:08,588 --> 01:09:10,654
or they do well on the school
test they didn't study for.

834
01:09:10,656 --> 01:09:13,524
But I only met two or three
people in my whole life

835
01:09:13,526 --> 01:09:15,127
who knew they shined.

836
01:09:17,430 --> 01:09:19,597
The baseball boy shined.

837
01:09:19,599 --> 01:09:22,101
His name was Bradley Trevor.

838
01:09:24,504 --> 01:09:26,837
These people...

839
01:09:26,839 --> 01:09:29,575
they look like people anyway,
they took him.

840
01:09:30,710 --> 01:09:32,778
And they ate him.

841
01:09:33,813 --> 01:09:36,547
They ate his shine.

842
01:09:36,549 --> 01:09:39,082
You could feel it?

843
01:09:39,084 --> 01:09:40,486
And they could feel me.

844
01:09:42,354 --> 01:09:43,787
If you could get
something of his,

845
01:09:43,789 --> 01:09:45,321
if you could go to Iowa...

846
01:09:45,323 --> 01:09:47,156
- Whoa, hang on.
- I can help you find him.

847
01:09:47,158 --> 01:09:48,626
Then his parents would know
where he was.

848
01:09:48,628 --> 01:09:50,594
They could bury him right,
at least.

849
01:09:50,596 --> 01:09:52,663
We could also get his glove.

850
01:09:52,665 --> 01:09:54,631
If I can touch that glove,
I can track them.

851
01:09:54,633 --> 01:09:56,299
Easy. Easy.

852
01:09:56,301 --> 01:09:58,869
Because Barry the Chunk,
I think that was his name,

853
01:09:58,871 --> 01:10:01,137
for a while,
before they killed him,

854
01:10:01,139 --> 01:10:03,108
he was wearing it.

855
01:10:14,252 --> 01:10:17,420
Abra, go home.

856
01:10:17,422 --> 01:10:19,389
Don't chase these people.

857
01:10:19,391 --> 01:10:21,424
Don't aggravate them.

858
01:10:21,426 --> 01:10:24,561
And whatever you do,
don't attract their attention.

859
01:10:24,563 --> 01:10:26,295
Find something, anything,

860
01:10:26,297 --> 01:10:30,466
well, almost anything,
to stop that shine of yours.

861
01:10:30,468 --> 01:10:32,334
Keep your head down
and hope to God

862
01:10:32,336 --> 01:10:34,804
that these people
or anything like them,

863
01:10:34,806 --> 01:10:37,607
that they don't see you.

864
01:10:37,609 --> 01:10:40,275
If they see you,
they come back.

865
01:10:40,277 --> 01:10:42,379
Abra, do you hear me?

866
01:10:43,247 --> 01:10:45,482
They come back.

867
01:10:47,451 --> 01:10:49,787
Keep your head down.
Stay safe.

868
01:10:51,322 --> 01:10:53,223
I'm sorry.

869
01:11:03,467 --> 01:11:05,336
Hey, Azzie.

870
01:11:17,848 --> 01:11:20,482
You got your wires
crossed tonight.

871
01:11:22,886 --> 01:11:24,722
That room's empty, Az.

872
01:11:29,258 --> 01:11:31,461
There's no one in that room.

873
01:11:39,669 --> 01:11:42,703
Whoa! Hang on, Doc.

874
01:11:42,705 --> 01:11:43,706
Dick.

875
01:11:45,241 --> 01:11:46,907
Oh, I'm so sorry.

876
01:11:46,909 --> 01:11:48,509
I... I... I thought it was...

877
01:11:48,511 --> 01:11:50,378
Thought I was
from the Overlook.

878
01:11:50,380 --> 01:11:52,713
Almost locked me up.

879
01:11:52,715 --> 01:11:55,349
Still getting visits
from them old ghosts?

880
01:11:55,351 --> 01:11:57,251
No, not for years.

881
01:11:57,253 --> 01:11:58,886
Horace Derwent
was the last one,

882
01:11:58,888 --> 01:12:00,621
confetti on his suit.

883
01:12:00,623 --> 01:12:02,590
Said, "Great party, isn't it?"

884
01:12:02,592 --> 01:12:04,257
Shit-eating grin on his face

885
01:12:04,259 --> 01:12:05,960
till I pulled out
a box for him.

886
01:12:05,962 --> 01:12:09,229
That grin went fast.

887
01:12:09,231 --> 01:12:11,532
Hey, it never occurred to me
to ask you back then,

888
01:12:11,534 --> 01:12:13,366
what happens to them
in those boxes?

889
01:12:13,368 --> 01:12:14,735
Do they die in there?

890
01:12:14,737 --> 01:12:16,438
Do you care?

891
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:19,774
I missed you.

892
01:12:19,776 --> 01:12:21,309
Has it been a long time?

893
01:12:22,577 --> 01:12:24,945
Can't tell.

894
01:12:24,947 --> 01:12:28,815
This world is a dream
of a dream to me now.

895
01:12:28,817 --> 01:12:31,918
Eight years. Little more.

896
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:34,320
Why are you here?

897
01:12:34,322 --> 01:12:37,824
I'm here because
it all comes 'round.

898
01:12:37,826 --> 01:12:40,794
Ka's a wheel, Doc.

899
01:12:40,796 --> 01:12:44,330
These empty devils
ever found you

900
01:12:44,332 --> 01:12:45,899
when you was a tyke,

901
01:12:45,901 --> 01:12:48,368
if they'd even sniffed you,

902
01:12:48,370 --> 01:12:50,637
you'd be long dead.

903
01:12:50,639 --> 01:12:52,872
They eat screams,

904
01:12:52,874 --> 01:12:55,475
and drink pain,

905
01:12:55,477 --> 01:12:58,446
and they've noticed
that little girl.

906
01:12:59,513 --> 01:13:01,616
They might kill her,

907
01:13:02,516 --> 01:13:05,685
might turn her...

908
01:13:05,687 --> 01:13:08,620
or might keep her
till she's all used up,

909
01:13:08,622 --> 01:13:09,989
and that'd be worst of all.

910
01:13:09,991 --> 01:13:12,660
You can't let 'em.

911
01:13:14,295 --> 01:13:16,428
Why me?

912
01:13:16,430 --> 01:13:18,797
Because she found you.

913
01:13:18,799 --> 01:13:22,401
Because she showed up.
Hell, Doc, why me?

914
01:13:22,403 --> 01:13:24,670
You just walked on
into my kitchen one day,

915
01:13:24,672 --> 01:13:26,072
and I'm still on the hook.

916
01:13:26,074 --> 01:13:28,843
What the hell am I
supposed to do?

917
01:13:30,344 --> 01:13:33,547
Get her what she asked for.

918
01:13:34,815 --> 01:13:38,016
You won't see me again, Doc.

919
01:13:38,018 --> 01:13:40,521
This is my last dream.

920
01:13:46,093 --> 01:13:49,928
It seems to me
you grew up fine, son,

921
01:13:49,930 --> 01:13:52,767
but you still owe a debt.

922
01:13:56,837 --> 01:13:58,839
Pay it.

923
01:14:14,587 --> 01:14:16,654
- Hey.
- Hey, Mom.

924
01:14:16,656 --> 01:14:17,922
You feeling okay?

925
01:14:17,924 --> 01:14:19,957
We missed you at dinner.

926
01:14:19,959 --> 01:14:23,396
I'm okay.
Just had a rough day.

927
01:14:27,634 --> 01:14:30,468
I'm flying out to see Momo
in the morning.

928
01:14:30,470 --> 01:14:32,505
I'll be back as soon as I can.

929
01:14:34,007 --> 01:14:36,009
Abs, is she...

930
01:14:39,378 --> 01:14:41,848
Is she gonna pull through
this time?

931
01:14:45,717 --> 01:14:46,820
I don't know.

932
01:14:48,387 --> 01:14:49,788
I hope so.

933
01:14:50,656 --> 01:14:52,391
Tell her I love her.

934
01:17:35,184 --> 01:17:37,619
Keep sleeping, princess.

935
01:17:51,066 --> 01:17:54,334
You rubes.

936
01:17:54,336 --> 01:17:57,904
Spend your whole lives
making little boxes,

937
01:17:57,906 --> 01:18:00,941
little memories.

938
01:18:00,943 --> 01:18:03,910
Oh, you think
they make you so rich.

939
01:18:03,912 --> 01:18:06,148
You should see mine, kiddo.

940
01:18:07,615 --> 01:18:11,020
Oh, my mind's a cathedral.

941
01:18:14,123 --> 01:18:16,924
Well, hi there.

942
01:18:24,699 --> 01:18:25,867
Hmm.

943
01:18:40,915 --> 01:18:41,916
He said you'd come back.

944
01:18:44,152 --> 01:18:45,217
And you did.

945
01:18:47,188 --> 01:18:48,653
Good.

946
01:18:48,655 --> 01:18:49,790
No!

947
01:18:50,925 --> 01:18:54,260
Get back! Get back!

948
01:18:54,262 --> 01:18:57,098
You're just a fucking child!

949
01:19:02,270 --> 01:19:03,868
Where are you?

950
01:19:03,870 --> 01:19:06,172
Where? Where did you...
Where...

951
01:19:06,174 --> 01:19:08,207
What did you...
Where did you...

952
01:19:09,843 --> 01:19:10,844
No.

953
01:19:12,979 --> 01:19:14,846
Get out! Get out!

954
01:19:14,848 --> 01:19:16,047
<i>Get out!</i>

955
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:02,826
Rose?

956
01:20:02,828 --> 01:20:04,161
Trap.

957
01:20:04,163 --> 01:20:05,463
Trap.

958
01:20:05,465 --> 01:20:07,097
What the hell happened?

959
01:20:07,099 --> 01:20:08,699
Little bitch
set a trap for me.

960
01:20:08,701 --> 01:20:10,267
Oh, my God. Oh, your hand.

961
01:20:10,269 --> 01:20:12,002
Rose! Rose, calm down.

962
01:20:12,004 --> 01:20:14,238
We know where she is now,
right? Now we know.

963
01:20:14,240 --> 01:20:15,772
She was in my head!

964
01:20:15,774 --> 01:20:17,274
- What?
- Stealing!

965
01:20:17,276 --> 01:20:19,843
- What does she know?
- I don't know. I don't know.

966
01:20:19,845 --> 01:20:22,446
- How much does she...
- I don't know!

967
01:20:22,448 --> 01:20:24,714
- I don't know...
- There's a problem.

968
01:20:24,716 --> 01:20:25,781
Not now!

969
01:20:25,783 --> 01:20:26,886
Grampa Flick...

970
01:20:27,887 --> 01:20:29,854
I think he's cycling.

971
01:20:35,060 --> 01:20:37,927
<i>Uncle Dan!
Uncle Dan, I hurt her.</i>

972
01:20:37,929 --> 01:20:39,129
<i>I really hurt her.</i>

973
01:20:39,131 --> 01:20:40,863
I hurt her
and she deserved it,

974
01:20:40,865 --> 01:20:42,266
and that's not the best part.
The best part is...

975
01:20:42,268 --> 01:20:44,066
<i>The best part is
I got in her head.</i>

976
01:20:44,068 --> 01:20:45,868
<i>I got in her head.</i>

977
01:20:45,870 --> 01:20:48,137
<i>- Uncle Dan? Are you there?
- Oh, God, Abra.</i>

978
01:20:48,139 --> 01:20:49,306
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

979
01:20:49,308 --> 01:20:50,708
What have you done?

980
01:21:06,891 --> 01:21:09,325
Just talk to the kid.

981
01:21:09,327 --> 01:21:12,263
If we're gonna do this,
then let's do this.

982
01:21:14,933 --> 01:21:15,967
<i>Hi, Abra.</i>

983
01:21:20,205 --> 01:21:22,006
I can hear you.

984
01:21:26,009 --> 01:21:28,009
I don't understand.

985
01:21:28,011 --> 01:21:29,147
You will.

986
01:21:30,981 --> 01:21:33,982
I thought we lived forever.

987
01:21:33,984 --> 01:21:36,452
Did someone
promise you that, Andi?

988
01:21:36,454 --> 01:21:40,188
Did someone say
you're immortal?

989
01:21:40,190 --> 01:21:45,126
I said, "Live long, eat well."

990
01:21:45,128 --> 01:21:47,229
We can live long, very long.

991
01:21:47,231 --> 01:21:48,363
And we do,

992
01:21:48,365 --> 01:21:50,031
most of us.

993
01:21:50,033 --> 01:21:52,236
But we haven't
been eating well.

994
01:21:53,337 --> 01:21:56,304
Not for a long time.

995
01:21:56,306 --> 01:21:57,741
Rosie, he's going.

996
01:21:59,376 --> 01:22:00,510
Rosie.

997
01:22:06,416 --> 01:22:08,118
Yes, love?

998
01:22:09,152 --> 01:22:11,019
I'm scared.

999
01:22:11,021 --> 01:22:13,555
No, you're not.

1000
01:22:13,557 --> 01:22:17,091
You watched empires rise

1001
01:22:17,093 --> 01:22:19,126
and fall.

1002
01:22:19,128 --> 01:22:21,596
Cheered the gladiators
in Rome.

1003
01:22:21,598 --> 01:22:24,098
Sailed across oceans

1004
01:22:24,100 --> 01:22:26,200
to new worlds

1005
01:22:26,202 --> 01:22:27,369
while you fed on

1006
01:22:27,371 --> 01:22:32,206
kings, and princes, and popes.

1007
01:22:32,208 --> 01:22:35,009
They wrote myths of you,

1008
01:22:35,011 --> 01:22:37,344
and made statues,

1009
01:22:37,346 --> 01:22:42,116
and they trembled
in their villages, and beds...

1010
01:22:42,118 --> 01:22:45,021
and skyscrapers.

1011
01:22:46,055 --> 01:22:48,555
So, no...

1012
01:22:48,557 --> 01:22:51,427
...you're not scared.

1013
01:22:52,595 --> 01:22:54,863
You're a king,

1014
01:22:55,864 --> 01:22:59,402
and you eat fear.

1015
01:23:49,950 --> 01:23:51,184
Hey, bro.

1016
01:23:51,186 --> 01:23:52,518
You know, it's 4:00 a.m.

1017
01:23:52,520 --> 01:23:54,487
You've always seen me, Billy.

1018
01:23:54,489 --> 01:23:58,223
You have a good sense about
people, is that fair to say?

1019
01:23:58,225 --> 01:23:59,592
Yeah, what...

1020
01:23:59,594 --> 01:24:01,494
You think I'm an honest man?
A good man?

1021
01:24:01,496 --> 01:24:03,095
I do, I do. Dan, I...

1022
01:24:03,097 --> 01:24:04,630
I need your help.

1023
01:24:04,632 --> 01:24:06,365
The first thing I need is
for you to listen to a story

1024
01:24:06,367 --> 01:24:09,637
and try harder than you've
ever tried to believe me.

1025
01:24:26,086 --> 01:24:28,487
How's it going?

1026
01:24:28,489 --> 01:24:31,289
Oh, hey. Shouldn't you
be getting ready for school?

1027
01:24:31,291 --> 01:24:34,025
Yeah, but I wanted
to tag along.

1028
01:24:34,027 --> 01:24:35,527
How long
have you been driving?

1029
01:24:35,529 --> 01:24:39,166
A few hours or so. We should
get there tonight. Late.

1030
01:24:41,402 --> 01:24:43,100
Who's that?

1031
01:24:43,102 --> 01:24:45,404
He's my friend.

1032
01:24:45,406 --> 01:24:48,407
Maybe my best friend.

1033
01:24:48,409 --> 01:24:50,409
You should've seen her face.

1034
01:24:50,411 --> 01:24:52,477
She was scared, Uncle Dan.

1035
01:24:52,479 --> 01:24:54,378
Scared like
all those kids were scared.

1036
01:24:54,380 --> 01:24:56,180
All those kids she's killed.

1037
01:24:56,182 --> 01:24:59,150
She was so mad
and so scared that I got in.

1038
01:24:59,152 --> 01:25:00,752
That was a new trick.

1039
01:25:00,754 --> 01:25:02,520
I've never done that before.

1040
01:25:02,522 --> 01:25:04,390
Yeah, me neither.
What was it like?

1041
01:25:05,224 --> 01:25:06,657
Like a library.

1042
01:25:06,659 --> 01:25:09,095
I guess we're
all libraries inside.

1043
01:25:10,029 --> 01:25:11,529
How'd you do it?

1044
01:25:11,531 --> 01:25:13,531
Like this. Just a little push.

1045
01:25:19,071 --> 01:25:20,337
Abra!

1046
01:25:20,339 --> 01:25:22,375
Sorry! Sorry, sorry, sorry!

1047
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:29,012
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

1048
01:25:29,014 --> 01:25:30,481
It's okay.

1049
01:25:30,483 --> 01:25:31,617
What were all those boxes?

1050
01:25:32,418 --> 01:25:33,551
Nothing.

1051
01:25:33,553 --> 01:25:34,986
Liar.

1052
01:25:37,790 --> 01:25:40,356
When I was a kid,

1053
01:25:40,358 --> 01:25:41,759
younger than you,

1054
01:25:41,761 --> 01:25:43,359
I bumped into
something like these things

1055
01:25:43,361 --> 01:25:46,262
that ate like they do.

1056
01:25:46,264 --> 01:25:50,133
Only it wasn't a person,
it was a place.

1057
01:25:50,135 --> 01:25:54,637
They closed it down after
and let it rot.

1058
01:25:54,639 --> 01:25:57,576
But the things
that lived there, they...

1059
01:25:59,211 --> 01:26:01,277
Don't go poking around
in there again.

1060
01:26:01,279 --> 01:26:04,716
Okay, I won't. I promise.

1061
01:26:09,754 --> 01:26:11,189
Phew!

1062
01:26:17,262 --> 01:26:19,462
We're almost ready.
We're just loading up.

1063
01:26:19,464 --> 01:26:20,830
Good.

1064
01:26:20,832 --> 01:26:22,332
Get the caravan on the road

1065
01:26:22,334 --> 01:26:23,733
and we'll have her
in a day or two.

1066
01:26:23,735 --> 01:26:26,569
I don't think
you should come, Rosie.

1067
01:26:26,571 --> 01:26:29,371
The fuck did you just say?

1068
01:26:29,373 --> 01:26:31,774
She tagged you.
She got in your head.

1069
01:26:31,776 --> 01:26:33,510
Yeah, it won't happen again.

1070
01:26:33,512 --> 01:26:34,577
And who knows
how much she got to

1071
01:26:34,579 --> 01:26:35,745
before you kicked her out.

1072
01:26:35,747 --> 01:26:37,246
She's mine, Crow.

1073
01:26:37,248 --> 01:26:38,580
Right now, as far as we know,

1074
01:26:38,582 --> 01:26:41,216
you are the only one of us
she could track.

1075
01:26:41,218 --> 01:26:42,785
Now, if she sees you coming,

1076
01:26:42,787 --> 01:26:44,553
she could run

1077
01:26:44,555 --> 01:26:47,057
or set another trap.

1078
01:26:50,194 --> 01:26:53,629
You know I'm right about this.

1079
01:26:53,631 --> 01:26:55,666
If she pulls a trick on you...

1080
01:26:57,635 --> 01:26:59,535
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1081
01:26:59,537 --> 01:27:02,540
But I got some tricks
of my own.

1082
01:27:09,880 --> 01:27:11,749
Hey, I think
we're here.

1083
01:27:14,351 --> 01:27:16,718
Okay.

1084
01:27:16,720 --> 01:27:19,055
I'll see if I can get her.

1085
01:27:19,690 --> 01:27:20,691
Abra?

1086
01:27:22,626 --> 01:27:25,393
That's the sign.
Pull around back.

1087
01:27:25,395 --> 01:27:26,895
She says to pull around back.

1088
01:27:26,897 --> 01:27:28,229
And I'll tell you
when to stop.

1089
01:27:28,231 --> 01:27:30,333
She'll tell us when to stop.

1090
01:27:36,306 --> 01:27:37,672
I gotta tell you,
Danno,

1091
01:27:37,674 --> 01:27:39,240
I don't know whether

1092
01:27:39,242 --> 01:27:40,775
I hope you're right
or wrong about this.

1093
01:27:40,777 --> 01:27:44,645
I mean, if you're wrong,
my friend is crazy.

1094
01:27:44,647 --> 01:27:46,316
I mean, full-blown...

1095
01:27:47,250 --> 01:27:48,649
mental breakdown,

1096
01:27:48,651 --> 01:27:52,320
imaginary-monsters-
killing-imaginary-kids

1097
01:27:52,322 --> 01:27:53,754
bonkers.

1098
01:27:53,756 --> 01:27:57,458
But, you know,
I... I can work with that.

1099
01:27:57,460 --> 01:27:59,159
If you're right, though...

1100
01:27:59,161 --> 01:28:00,428
I know.

1101
01:28:00,430 --> 01:28:02,465
It's much worse.

1102
01:28:16,478 --> 01:28:17,812
You should go home.

1103
01:28:17,814 --> 01:28:19,579
What?

1104
01:28:19,581 --> 01:28:21,916
No, not you.

1105
01:28:21,918 --> 01:28:23,450
I can handle it.

1106
01:28:23,452 --> 01:28:26,221
No. We'll take it from here.

1107
01:28:28,657 --> 01:28:31,159
Okay, it's just us.

1108
01:28:47,709 --> 01:28:50,144
You smell that?

1109
01:28:51,947 --> 01:28:54,514
Used to hunt.
I ever tell you that?

1110
01:28:54,516 --> 01:28:55,815
No.

1111
01:28:55,817 --> 01:28:57,484
Deer.

1112
01:28:57,486 --> 01:28:59,786
This one summer,

1113
01:28:59,788 --> 01:29:01,721
I clipped this buck.

1114
01:29:01,723 --> 01:29:04,356
I was tracking it
for two days.

1115
01:29:04,358 --> 01:29:07,526
I got the shot, clipped him.

1116
01:29:07,528 --> 01:29:09,796
He ran off, I went after.

1117
01:29:09,798 --> 01:29:13,565
Figured he wasn't
gonna last long.

1118
01:29:14,870 --> 01:29:15,871
Then he vanished.

1119
01:29:16,804 --> 01:29:19,805
Just up and evaporated.

1120
01:29:19,807 --> 01:29:22,677
Not a trace.
Truly baffling.

1121
01:29:25,279 --> 01:29:26,712
Five days later,

1122
01:29:26,714 --> 01:29:29,648
I'm trying a different spot,
miles away.

1123
01:29:29,650 --> 01:29:33,554
I come around looking
for a spot for a blind,

1124
01:29:34,755 --> 01:29:36,791
then I smelled him.

1125
01:29:37,725 --> 01:29:39,493
Smelled him.

1126
01:29:40,326 --> 01:29:41,960
Found that buck

1127
01:29:41,962 --> 01:29:45,263
holed up to a hollow trunk.

1128
01:29:45,265 --> 01:29:46,901
Dead for days.

1129
01:29:48,301 --> 01:29:49,770
The smell...

1130
01:29:50,871 --> 01:29:53,373
Never hunted a day since.

1131
01:29:56,509 --> 01:29:58,846
This is the same smell.

1132
01:30:14,327 --> 01:30:15,595
Billy.

1133
01:30:35,314 --> 01:30:36,983
Oh, my God!

1134
01:31:09,381 --> 01:31:10,614
Fuck.

1135
01:31:10,616 --> 01:31:13,116
Fuck, Danno. What the fuck?

1136
01:31:13,118 --> 01:31:14,684
They didn't
even bury him deep.

1137
01:31:14,686 --> 01:31:15,752
They buried him shallow.

1138
01:31:15,754 --> 01:31:16,889
I'm sorry, Billy.

1139
01:31:18,123 --> 01:31:20,592
What did you
get us into?

1140
01:31:28,667 --> 01:31:30,133
The people who did that...

1141
01:31:30,135 --> 01:31:32,635
They're not people.

1142
01:31:32,637 --> 01:31:35,504
No. No, they ain't.

1143
01:31:35,506 --> 01:31:38,574
Anyone do that
to a little boy,

1144
01:31:38,576 --> 01:31:40,743
they ain't people.

1145
01:31:40,745 --> 01:31:42,078
Did you get it?

1146
01:31:42,080 --> 01:31:43,412
Yeah, we got it.

1147
01:31:43,414 --> 01:31:44,981
Is she back?

1148
01:31:44,983 --> 01:31:46,949
We're heading back to you.
We'll be back in the morning.

1149
01:31:46,951 --> 01:31:47,952
We got a stop to make.

1150
01:31:50,555 --> 01:31:53,589
I need you to show your
parents what's happening.

1151
01:31:53,591 --> 01:31:54,657
No.

1152
01:31:54,659 --> 01:31:55,891
- Yeah.
- No.

1153
01:31:55,893 --> 01:31:57,693
They almost think I'm normal.

1154
01:31:57,695 --> 01:31:59,128
If I tell them, they'll...

1155
01:31:59,130 --> 01:32:00,930
Rose'll go through them
to get to you.

1156
01:32:00,932 --> 01:32:02,531
You know that, don't you?

1157
01:32:02,533 --> 01:32:04,166
She'll cut them down
without a second thought.

1158
01:32:04,168 --> 01:32:06,602
And she's coming, Abra.

1159
01:32:06,604 --> 01:32:08,405
They need to know.

1160
01:32:12,977 --> 01:32:15,443
So, what's this stop
we gotta make?

1161
01:32:15,445 --> 01:32:17,715
You still got
those old deer rifles?

1162
01:32:35,066 --> 01:32:36,764
You're Uncle Dan?

1163
01:32:36,766 --> 01:32:38,466
- The fuck you think you are?
- Sir...

1164
01:32:38,468 --> 01:32:40,468
Hmm? She is 13 years old!

1165
01:32:40,470 --> 01:32:41,836
Abra, I told you to show him.

1166
01:32:41,838 --> 01:32:43,638
- I told him.
- Well, that's not the same.

1167
01:32:43,640 --> 01:32:44,906
I'm gonna kick your ass
before I call the police, huh?

1168
01:32:44,908 --> 01:32:46,074
- Hey, hey, hey!
- No, no, no. Abra.

1169
01:32:46,076 --> 01:32:47,175
Now, don't you say her name.

1170
01:32:47,177 --> 01:32:49,444
Abra...

1171
01:33:03,026 --> 01:33:06,560
I'm sorry, Mr. Stone.
I am a friend.

1172
01:33:06,562 --> 01:33:08,865
Everything she told you
is true.

1173
01:33:20,576 --> 01:33:21,742
No, thanks.

1174
01:33:21,744 --> 01:33:22,745
No.

1175
01:33:32,087 --> 01:33:33,856
Those people,

1176
01:33:35,024 --> 01:33:36,957
they know about my daughter?

1177
01:33:36,959 --> 01:33:38,759
They do.

1178
01:33:38,761 --> 01:33:41,528
And sooner or later,
they're coming.

1179
01:33:41,530 --> 01:33:42,930
We gotta do something.

1180
01:33:42,932 --> 01:33:44,865
All right, we're calling
the police, the FBI...

1181
01:33:44,867 --> 01:33:47,701
These people have been
around a long, long time, sir.

1182
01:33:47,703 --> 01:33:49,269
They're rich, connected.

1183
01:33:49,271 --> 01:33:51,805
I don't think they're worried
about the police.

1184
01:33:51,807 --> 01:33:53,206
But where are they?

1185
01:33:53,208 --> 01:33:55,742
When are they coming?
Where can we go?

1186
01:33:55,744 --> 01:33:57,677
Abra can answer that,

1187
01:33:57,679 --> 01:33:59,148
if she's ready.

1188
01:34:00,149 --> 01:34:01,951
I'm ready.

1189
01:34:11,193 --> 01:34:13,160
You sure you wanna do this?

1190
01:34:13,162 --> 01:34:14,862
I have to.

1191
01:34:56,937 --> 01:34:58,670
I-95.

1192
01:34:58,672 --> 01:35:01,606
Barry, the Crow, the Snake,
and a few others.

1193
01:35:01,608 --> 01:35:02,907
The trees haven't
changed that much,

1194
01:35:02,909 --> 01:35:04,943
so maybe Massachusetts,

1195
01:35:04,945 --> 01:35:07,645
- but they're close.
- Rose?

1196
01:35:07,647 --> 01:35:09,281
Didn't see her.

1197
01:35:09,283 --> 01:35:10,717
But they're coming.

1198
01:35:14,654 --> 01:35:17,188
This is the only room she saw?

1199
01:35:17,190 --> 01:35:18,690
That's right.

1200
01:35:18,692 --> 01:35:21,860
And I made a few changes.
Hid a few things.

1201
01:35:21,862 --> 01:35:23,928
All right.

1202
01:35:23,930 --> 01:35:26,231
Well, they'll be trying
to track you,

1203
01:35:26,233 --> 01:35:28,035
trying to catch on.

1204
01:35:29,770 --> 01:35:32,337
And you're gonna let them.

1205
01:35:32,339 --> 01:35:34,072
Are you crazy?

1206
01:35:34,074 --> 01:35:36,341
Possibly, but you're
gonna let them,

1207
01:35:36,343 --> 01:35:38,945
and then I need you to try
and do a little trick.

1208
01:35:39,779 --> 01:35:41,114
A magic trick?

1209
01:35:49,056 --> 01:35:50,954
They're following us.

1210
01:35:50,956 --> 01:35:53,160
Concentrate. You gotta
keep it up until they land.

1211
01:35:54,026 --> 01:35:55,061
I know.

1212
01:36:26,859 --> 01:36:28,258
This should work.

1213
01:36:28,260 --> 01:36:31,063
Good blinds over there,
and there.

1214
01:36:34,100 --> 01:36:35,232
They still close?

1215
01:36:35,234 --> 01:36:37,134
Getting closer, I think.

1216
01:36:37,136 --> 01:36:38,302
This is tough.

1217
01:36:38,304 --> 01:36:40,972
I know. I know.
How much longer?

1218
01:36:44,676 --> 01:36:46,245
Okay, Crow Daddy,

1219
01:36:47,078 --> 01:36:49,047
go get her.

1220
01:37:35,426 --> 01:37:37,993
You look relaxed.

1221
01:37:37,995 --> 01:37:41,131
You feel relaxed,
don't you, Abra?

1222
01:37:41,798 --> 01:37:42,931
I guess.

1223
01:37:42,933 --> 01:37:44,799
You should.

1224
01:37:44,801 --> 01:37:46,334
Just relax.

1225
01:37:46,336 --> 01:37:48,236
We're friends.

1226
01:37:48,238 --> 01:37:49,971
You're friends.

1227
01:37:49,973 --> 01:37:51,341
That's right.

1228
01:37:52,142 --> 01:37:54,242
Just friends.

1229
01:37:54,244 --> 01:37:59,047
And we want to take you
to meet more friends.

1230
01:37:59,049 --> 01:38:00,450
Good friends.

1231
01:38:04,754 --> 01:38:06,154
Well, shit.

1232
01:38:06,156 --> 01:38:07,855
The way they talked you up,

1233
01:38:07,857 --> 01:38:09,457
I was thinking it'd be
a little harder than that.

1234
01:38:14,464 --> 01:38:16,164
The fuck?

1235
01:38:16,166 --> 01:38:18,866
Parlor tricks.
Just fuckin' parlor tricks.

1236
01:38:23,039 --> 01:38:24,772
No! Get out of there!

1237
01:38:24,774 --> 01:38:25,808
Get out of there!

1238
01:38:32,315 --> 01:38:33,849
No!

1239
01:38:47,863 --> 01:38:48,898
No!

1240
01:38:57,973 --> 01:38:59,540
<i>You deserve it.</i>

1241
01:38:59,542 --> 01:39:02,409
You deserve it.
All of you.

1242
01:39:07,450 --> 01:39:08,451
No!

1243
01:40:04,071 --> 01:40:05,372
Oh, fuck.

1244
01:40:07,241 --> 01:40:08,242
Stop.

1245
01:40:13,047 --> 01:40:16,116
I just got one question
for you, sweetie.

1246
01:40:17,184 --> 01:40:18,984
Aren't you sleepy?

1247
01:40:21,555 --> 01:40:23,357
You're sleepy.

1248
01:40:28,228 --> 01:40:29,296
Sleep.

1249
01:40:31,198 --> 01:40:32,199
Sleep.

1250
01:40:34,101 --> 01:40:36,568
Wake up! Uncle Dan!

1251
01:40:36,570 --> 01:40:38,969
Wake up! Wake up.

1252
01:40:38,971 --> 01:40:41,440
<i>Wake up!</i>

1253
01:40:41,442 --> 01:40:43,344
Fucking men.

1254
01:40:44,911 --> 01:40:46,846
Fucking men.

1255
01:41:02,962 --> 01:41:04,263
Stay back, Billy.

1256
01:41:07,500 --> 01:41:09,302
Kill yourself.

1257
01:41:11,704 --> 01:41:13,104
No!

1258
01:41:13,106 --> 01:41:14,273
Billy!

1259
01:41:30,956 --> 01:41:33,189
There is one missing.

1260
01:41:33,191 --> 01:41:34,692
I didn't see the Crow.

1261
01:41:34,694 --> 01:41:36,329
Where is the Crow?

1262
01:41:38,230 --> 01:41:39,432
Hello, Abra.

1263
01:41:45,470 --> 01:41:47,439
Abra!

1264
01:42:20,037 --> 01:42:22,474
Oh, good, you're awake.

1265
01:42:32,383 --> 01:42:33,449
Dan...

1266
01:42:33,451 --> 01:42:35,052
Don't bother.

1267
01:42:42,059 --> 01:42:44,092
What's wrong with me?

1268
01:42:44,094 --> 01:42:46,261
You've been dosed, missy.

1269
01:42:46,263 --> 01:42:48,630
More than
I've ever used before.

1270
01:42:48,632 --> 01:42:51,467
Might let you wake up
here and there,

1271
01:42:51,469 --> 01:42:53,637
but that steam of yours
is fast asleep.

1272
01:42:56,774 --> 01:42:59,374
My dad...

1273
01:42:59,376 --> 01:43:01,376
What happened to my dad?

1274
01:43:01,378 --> 01:43:04,045
Lot of good people
killed today.

1275
01:43:04,047 --> 01:43:07,081
Lot of good people.

1276
01:43:07,083 --> 01:43:09,451
I'd love to tell you
someone will pay,

1277
01:43:09,453 --> 01:43:13,289
some kind of justice raining
down on the sad events today,

1278
01:43:14,425 --> 01:43:16,758
but it don't work like that.

1279
01:43:16,760 --> 01:43:19,761
We were always gonna have you.

1280
01:43:19,763 --> 01:43:22,430
Some of my people are dead.

1281
01:43:22,432 --> 01:43:24,833
Some of yours are dead.

1282
01:43:24,835 --> 01:43:28,269
Outcome didn't change, though.

1283
01:43:28,271 --> 01:43:30,471
Think on that a minute.

1284
01:43:30,473 --> 01:43:32,774
The outcome didn't change.

1285
01:43:32,776 --> 01:43:34,344
So, their deaths,

1286
01:43:35,211 --> 01:43:37,144
all of them,

1287
01:43:37,146 --> 01:43:39,313
just a waste.

1288
01:43:39,315 --> 01:43:42,717
A waste you brought on
to us all, young lady.

1289
01:43:42,719 --> 01:43:44,352
For what?

1290
01:43:45,688 --> 01:43:47,688
Please hear me...

1291
01:43:47,690 --> 01:43:50,424
Ain't nobody hearing you.

1292
01:43:50,426 --> 01:43:54,262
Might as well calm down
and enjoy the ride.

1293
01:43:54,264 --> 01:43:56,430
Like I said,

1294
01:43:56,432 --> 01:43:58,735
outcome hasn't changed.

1295
01:44:18,888 --> 01:44:20,422
No.

1296
01:44:21,791 --> 01:44:23,590
Please.

1297
01:44:23,592 --> 01:44:26,228
Oh, please, please, please.

1298
01:44:26,896 --> 01:44:28,530
Please.

1299
01:44:31,633 --> 01:44:33,502
Abra!

1300
01:44:36,371 --> 01:44:38,140
<i>Abra.</i>

1301
01:44:44,646 --> 01:44:45,814
Tony?

1302
01:44:47,849 --> 01:44:50,519
Help me, please, Tony.

1303
01:44:55,624 --> 01:44:57,091
God.

1304
01:45:07,401 --> 01:45:09,501
Okay. Okay.

1305
01:45:09,503 --> 01:45:10,937
Okay, okay.

1306
01:45:10,939 --> 01:45:13,539
Okay, you always said...

1307
01:45:13,541 --> 01:45:15,307
your brain was like a radio.

1308
01:45:15,309 --> 01:45:18,210
No one's answering when
you call, so stop calling.

1309
01:45:18,212 --> 01:45:20,214
And just listen.

1310
01:45:37,297 --> 01:45:39,565
<i>Dan. Dan.</i>

1311
01:45:39,567 --> 01:45:40,568
<i>Help.</i>

1312
01:45:54,949 --> 01:45:56,381
Hi.

1313
01:45:56,383 --> 01:45:58,218
Dan.

1314
01:46:00,453 --> 01:46:01,889
Did he drug you?

1315
01:46:03,289 --> 01:46:05,958
I'm so sorry.

1316
01:46:05,960 --> 01:46:07,993
I'm gonna try something, okay?

1317
01:46:07,995 --> 01:46:09,327
But you're weak.

1318
01:46:09,329 --> 01:46:10,895
He's blocking you.

1319
01:46:10,897 --> 01:46:13,531
I could barely hear you.

1320
01:46:13,533 --> 01:46:15,368
You gotta trust me, okay?

1321
01:46:16,536 --> 01:46:18,171
Okay?

1322
01:46:31,818 --> 01:46:34,952
Awake again, huh?

1323
01:46:34,954 --> 01:46:37,957
Might have to dose you
at the next rest stop.

1324
01:46:39,626 --> 01:46:41,525
Where are we going?

1325
01:46:41,527 --> 01:46:44,461
Mmm, you know where.

1326
01:46:44,463 --> 01:46:46,866
Fuck, I feel hungover.

1327
01:46:49,268 --> 01:46:51,735
I told you it's good shit.

1328
01:46:51,737 --> 01:46:53,670
Haven't felt hungover
in years.

1329
01:46:53,672 --> 01:46:54,972
And, you know,
I don't miss it.

1330
01:46:54,974 --> 01:46:56,542
Not even a little.

1331
01:46:58,477 --> 01:47:00,377
West, huh?

1332
01:47:00,379 --> 01:47:03,315
Stayin' off the major roads.
Smart.

1333
01:47:05,551 --> 01:47:08,220
Crownville. New York.

1334
01:47:10,889 --> 01:47:13,423
Who are you?

1335
01:47:13,425 --> 01:47:15,894
I'm the guy
that killed your friends.

1336
01:47:21,066 --> 01:47:23,334
It's nice to meet you.

1337
01:47:24,435 --> 01:47:25,969
Neat trick.

1338
01:47:25,971 --> 01:47:28,038
Haven't seen this one before.

1339
01:47:28,040 --> 01:47:29,975
Wanna see one more?

1340
01:47:32,945 --> 01:47:36,748
Don't imagine Rose'll be too
happy if you shoot the prize.

1341
01:47:39,017 --> 01:47:42,752
I don't suppose Rose will be
happy about any of this.

1342
01:47:42,754 --> 01:47:45,521
And when that woman gets mad,

1343
01:47:45,523 --> 01:47:46,689
well,

1344
01:47:46,691 --> 01:47:48,058
it seems to me you know enough

1345
01:47:48,060 --> 01:47:50,793
to know you might
wanna sit this one out.

1346
01:47:50,795 --> 01:47:52,628
Count your blessings.

1347
01:47:52,630 --> 01:47:53,631
Go on your way.

1348
01:47:56,501 --> 01:47:58,100
What's so funny, friend?

1349
01:47:58,102 --> 01:48:02,338
Well, it's just arrogance.
It's arrogance, really.

1350
01:48:02,340 --> 01:48:03,672
But it makes sense,

1351
01:48:03,674 --> 01:48:05,674
if you think
you're gonna live forever.

1352
01:48:05,676 --> 01:48:07,877
Stands to reason,

1353
01:48:07,879 --> 01:48:10,014
of course you wouldn't
wear your seatbelt.

1354
01:48:19,724 --> 01:48:22,860
No!

1355
01:48:33,370 --> 01:48:34,938
Dan?

1356
01:48:36,006 --> 01:48:37,372
Dan?

1357
01:49:08,637 --> 01:49:10,805
I hope that hurts.

1358
01:49:10,807 --> 01:49:12,907
Rosie...

1359
01:49:12,909 --> 01:49:14,843
A lot.

1360
01:50:01,891 --> 01:50:04,392
You little bitch.

1361
01:50:06,694 --> 01:50:08,563
What have you done?

1362
01:50:19,807 --> 01:50:22,010
All right, bitch child.

1363
01:50:22,710 --> 01:50:23,711
All right.

1364
01:51:31,812 --> 01:51:33,011
Sorry.

1365
01:51:33,013 --> 01:51:34,179
Dozed off.

1366
01:51:34,181 --> 01:51:36,950
No, you earned it.

1367
01:51:39,585 --> 01:51:40,784
Where are we?

1368
01:51:40,786 --> 01:51:42,753
Ohio.

1369
01:51:42,755 --> 01:51:43,887
Where are we going?

1370
01:51:43,889 --> 01:51:45,058
Colorado.

1371
01:51:46,293 --> 01:51:48,627
Why Colorado?

1372
01:51:50,763 --> 01:51:53,298
She's gonna keep coming.

1373
01:51:53,300 --> 01:51:56,267
- I know.
- Always.

1374
01:51:56,269 --> 01:51:58,135
This only ends if we end it,

1375
01:51:58,137 --> 01:52:00,204
and I don't think
we can beat her.

1376
01:52:00,206 --> 01:52:02,208
Not by ourselves.

1377
01:52:04,043 --> 01:52:05,609
There's a place.

1378
01:52:05,611 --> 01:52:08,312
A place that's dangerous
for people like us.

1379
01:52:08,314 --> 01:52:11,648
The place you told me about?
The hungry place?

1380
01:52:11,650 --> 01:52:13,083
Yeah, that's right.

1381
01:52:13,085 --> 01:52:16,186
If it's so dangerous,
why would we go there?

1382
01:52:16,188 --> 01:52:18,288
Well, if it's dangerous
for people like us,

1383
01:52:18,290 --> 01:52:21,624
I expect it's dangerous
for people like her.

1384
01:52:21,626 --> 01:52:23,262
Maybe even more so.

1385
01:52:24,263 --> 01:52:26,230
Good.

1386
01:52:26,232 --> 01:52:29,199
She's following us, you know.

1387
01:52:29,201 --> 01:52:31,703
Yeah, good. Let her.

1388
01:52:38,877 --> 01:52:41,213
I'm sorry about your father.

1389
01:52:43,081 --> 01:52:45,683
Sorry about your friend.

1390
01:53:07,638 --> 01:53:09,906
It's my mom.

1391
01:53:09,908 --> 01:53:12,141
What do I say to her?

1392
01:53:16,047 --> 01:53:17,113
Hi, Mom.

1393
01:53:17,115 --> 01:53:18,347
Oh, thank God!

1394
01:53:18,349 --> 01:53:19,714
Abra,

1395
01:53:19,716 --> 01:53:21,319
are you okay?
Where are you?

1396
01:53:22,220 --> 01:53:23,987
I love you.

1397
01:53:26,324 --> 01:53:27,989
When we're safe,

1398
01:53:27,991 --> 01:53:28,957
you'll call her
and tell her where to find us?

1399
01:53:28,959 --> 01:53:30,092
I will.

1400
01:53:30,094 --> 01:53:31,262
Okay.

1401
01:54:05,229 --> 01:54:07,663
Not too much further.
Up the mountain.

1402
01:55:43,091 --> 01:55:44,890
Here's what we're gonna do.

1403
01:55:44,892 --> 01:55:47,826
You're gonna stay in the car,
keep the heater running.

1404
01:55:47,828 --> 01:55:49,828
I don't want you spending
a minute inside there

1405
01:55:49,830 --> 01:55:51,063
if you don't have to.

1406
01:55:51,065 --> 01:55:52,864
She can only come from here.

1407
01:55:52,866 --> 01:55:54,267
You can see her
a mile out, easy.

1408
01:55:54,269 --> 01:55:56,802
You see lights
on the mountain over there,

1409
01:55:56,804 --> 01:55:58,371
you blast me, okay?

1410
01:55:58,373 --> 01:56:01,507
But I don't want you going in.
Not until she's here.

1411
01:56:01,509 --> 01:56:04,109
You aren't waiting with me?

1412
01:56:04,111 --> 01:56:05,244
I can't.

1413
01:56:05,246 --> 01:56:07,112
Why not?

1414
01:56:07,114 --> 01:56:09,083
I have to wake it up.

1415
01:57:10,510 --> 01:57:12,512
Wakey-wakey.

1416
02:01:25,660 --> 02:01:27,660
Slow night, Mr. Torrance.

1417
02:01:27,662 --> 02:01:31,330
Not for long, I imagine.

1418
02:01:31,332 --> 02:01:33,399
You're a whiskey man,
are you not?

1419
02:01:33,401 --> 02:01:35,670
I was, most of the time.

1420
02:01:43,209 --> 02:01:45,111
On the house.

1421
02:01:48,381 --> 02:01:50,548
This was your brand.

1422
02:01:50,550 --> 02:01:52,283
Jack Daniel's.

1423
02:01:52,285 --> 02:01:54,687
I used to see the bottles
in our home.

1424
02:01:54,689 --> 02:01:58,222
Our real home,
before all this.

1425
02:01:58,224 --> 02:02:01,461
I smelled one once. It smelled
like something on fire,

1426
02:02:02,596 --> 02:02:05,396
which I suppose it was.

1427
02:02:05,398 --> 02:02:07,799
I'm afraid you've
confused me with someone else.

1428
02:02:07,801 --> 02:02:10,201
It's Lloyd.

1429
02:02:10,203 --> 02:02:11,504
Lloyd.

1430
02:02:12,572 --> 02:02:14,706
I apologize, Mr. Torrance.

1431
02:02:14,708 --> 02:02:16,374
I don't know
where everyone is,

1432
02:02:16,376 --> 02:02:18,676
but it'll pick up.

1433
02:02:18,678 --> 02:02:20,612
Oh, I know where they are.

1434
02:02:20,614 --> 02:02:22,282
And you're right,

1435
02:02:22,949 --> 02:02:24,017
it'll pick up.

1436
02:02:26,185 --> 02:02:29,623
If you don't mind my saying,
Mr. Torrance, you seem...

1437
02:02:30,389 --> 02:02:31,758
put upon.

1438
02:02:32,424 --> 02:02:34,224
Put upon?

1439
02:02:34,226 --> 02:02:35,793
Pulled into
other people's problems.

1440
02:02:35,795 --> 02:02:39,231
I see it all the time,
if you don't mind my saying.

1441
02:02:41,634 --> 02:02:43,870
So we lived in Florida.

1442
02:02:44,570 --> 02:02:45,702
I'm sorry?

1443
02:02:45,704 --> 02:02:47,239
Mom and I.

1444
02:02:48,842 --> 02:02:51,943
We never wanted
to see snow again,

1445
02:02:51,945 --> 02:02:53,911
so we lived in Florida.

1446
02:02:53,913 --> 02:02:55,445
Tiny place,

1447
02:02:55,447 --> 02:02:56,582
but it was comfortable,
and we were happy.

1448
02:02:58,884 --> 02:03:01,385
I was 20 when she died.

1449
02:03:01,387 --> 02:03:05,255
And back then, I saw
when someone was gonna die.

1450
02:03:05,257 --> 02:03:07,491
I saw flies. Black flies.

1451
02:03:07,493 --> 02:03:11,328
"Death flies," I called them,
circling people's faces.

1452
02:03:11,330 --> 02:03:13,964
And in those last weeks,
she was covered,

1453
02:03:13,966 --> 02:03:15,832
her whole face.

1454
02:03:15,834 --> 02:03:19,235
I could barely see her eyes.

1455
02:03:19,237 --> 02:03:21,972
And I...
And I tried to comfort her,

1456
02:03:21,974 --> 02:03:23,940
but I could hardly
look at her.

1457
02:03:23,942 --> 02:03:26,277
And she saw that.

1458
02:03:31,315 --> 02:03:34,750
Maybe something warm to push
away such unpleasantries.

1459
02:03:34,752 --> 02:03:37,921
Don't you wanna hear about it?
She was your wife.

1460
02:03:37,923 --> 02:03:41,024
I think you've mistaken me
for someone else.

1461
02:03:41,026 --> 02:03:42,961
- I'm just a bartender.
- Oh, yeah?

1462
02:03:44,562 --> 02:03:45,895
Just Lloyd the bartender,

1463
02:03:45,897 --> 02:03:47,630
pouring joy
at the Overlook Hotel.

1464
02:03:47,632 --> 02:03:50,702
I'll pour whatever you like,
Mr. Torrance.

1465
02:03:57,575 --> 02:03:59,544
Man takes a drink,

1466
02:04:00,545 --> 02:04:03,045
the drink takes a drink,

1467
02:04:03,047 --> 02:04:05,915
and then the drink
takes a man.

1468
02:04:05,917 --> 02:04:07,752
Ain't it so, Dad?

1469
02:04:11,789 --> 02:04:13,758
Medicine.

1470
02:04:14,726 --> 02:04:17,660
Medicine is what it is.

1471
02:04:17,662 --> 02:04:20,528
Bona fide cure-all.

1472
02:04:20,530 --> 02:04:23,431
The mind is a blackboard.

1473
02:04:23,433 --> 02:04:25,034
And this...

1474
02:04:25,036 --> 02:04:26,837
is the eraser.

1475
02:04:31,742 --> 02:04:34,076
A man tries.

1476
02:04:34,078 --> 02:04:36,511
He provides.

1477
02:04:36,513 --> 02:04:38,980
But he's surrounded by mouths.

1478
02:04:38,982 --> 02:04:41,015
And a family.

1479
02:04:41,017 --> 02:04:44,486
A wife, a kid.

1480
02:04:44,488 --> 02:04:46,888
Those mouths eat time.

1481
02:04:46,890 --> 02:04:48,725
They eat your days on earth.

1482
02:04:49,860 --> 02:04:51,327
They just gobble them up.

1483
02:04:53,029 --> 02:04:56,564
It's enough
to make a man sick.

1484
02:04:56,566 --> 02:04:57,567
And this...

1485
02:04:58,735 --> 02:05:00,704
is the medicine.

1486
02:05:02,906 --> 02:05:05,874
So, tell me, pup,

1487
02:05:05,876 --> 02:05:08,945
are you gonna
take your medicine?

1488
02:05:12,648 --> 02:05:13,649
I'm not.

1489
02:05:16,719 --> 02:05:18,019
<i>Dan!</i>

1490
02:05:18,021 --> 02:05:19,588
<i>She's here.</i>

1491
02:05:37,373 --> 02:05:39,340
Okay.

1492
02:05:53,088 --> 02:05:55,722
This place is sick.

1493
02:05:55,724 --> 02:05:58,125
Sick like my momo was sick.

1494
02:05:58,127 --> 02:06:00,027
It's cancer,

1495
02:06:00,029 --> 02:06:01,596
only worse.

1496
02:06:09,571 --> 02:06:10,870
What do we do now?

1497
02:06:10,872 --> 02:06:13,341
We head inside.
She'll find us.

1498
02:08:03,015 --> 02:08:05,017
Well, well, well.

1499
02:08:07,086 --> 02:08:08,919
Hi there.

1500
02:08:08,921 --> 02:08:12,056
<i>When this starts, run.</i>

1501
02:08:12,058 --> 02:08:14,959
Yes, you run, dear.

1502
02:08:14,961 --> 02:08:17,560
And then I will find you,

1503
02:08:17,562 --> 02:08:23,267
and you will scream for years
until you die.

1504
02:08:23,269 --> 02:08:26,070
We'll see who does
the screaming.

1505
02:08:26,072 --> 02:08:27,770
Oh, we'll see indeed.

1506
02:08:27,772 --> 02:08:29,806
She's right, you know.

1507
02:08:29,808 --> 02:08:31,843
You should be afraid.

1508
02:08:32,677 --> 02:08:34,877
Why is that?

1509
02:08:34,879 --> 02:08:37,680
Because you don't know
where you're standing.

1510
02:08:37,682 --> 02:08:40,618
I'm sorry, who are you,
handsome?

1511
02:08:44,089 --> 02:08:47,559
You're the one who killed
my Crow, aren't you?

1512
02:08:48,593 --> 02:08:49,594
Go.

1513
02:09:51,021 --> 02:09:53,355
Clever.

1514
02:09:53,357 --> 02:09:55,259
You've made some improvements,
haven't you?

1515
02:09:56,827 --> 02:09:59,660
Since the last time
I was in your mind.

1516
02:09:59,662 --> 02:10:01,932
How do you know
we're not in yours?

1517
02:10:15,978 --> 02:10:17,214
Where are you, pup?

1518
02:10:38,067 --> 02:10:39,735
You're gonna die here.

1519
02:10:40,736 --> 02:10:43,871
Mmm. Brave words, dear.

1520
02:10:43,873 --> 02:10:46,140
Is that what you really think?

1521
02:10:46,142 --> 02:10:48,309
You're gonna hurt me?

1522
02:10:48,311 --> 02:10:49,877
Yes.

1523
02:10:56,751 --> 02:10:59,955
You know,
you remind me of myself.

1524
02:11:01,424 --> 02:11:03,756
I can really see it now.

1525
02:11:03,758 --> 02:11:06,293
You've got a darkness
in you, dear.

1526
02:11:06,295 --> 02:11:09,898
I think the only difference
between you and me is time.

1527
02:11:19,374 --> 02:11:20,642
You don't know yet

1528
02:11:21,343 --> 02:11:22,344
what you'd do...

1529
02:11:23,745 --> 02:11:24,813
for more time.

1530
02:11:26,781 --> 02:11:30,152
But I promise you, dear,
oh, you'd be surprised.

1531
02:11:35,756 --> 02:11:37,658
Pain purifies steam.

1532
02:11:38,792 --> 02:11:42,430
Fear, too, so, you understand.

1533
02:11:55,310 --> 02:11:56,842
Hmm.

1534
02:12:02,149 --> 02:12:04,883
I was just like you
when I was younger.

1535
02:12:04,885 --> 02:12:07,352
I was special,

1536
02:12:07,354 --> 02:12:08,921
and alone.

1537
02:12:08,923 --> 02:12:10,355
But I met someone who gave me

1538
02:12:10,357 --> 02:12:12,124
the gift of purpose,
of community,

1539
02:12:12,126 --> 02:12:13,759
and I might have
given you such a gift

1540
02:12:13,761 --> 02:12:17,131
if things would have
gone differently.

1541
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:21,967
No?

1542
02:12:21,969 --> 02:12:23,969
Defiant, aren't you?

1543
02:12:25,105 --> 02:12:26,804
So much like me.

1544
02:12:26,806 --> 02:12:29,176
Your mind is so...

1545
02:12:32,112 --> 02:12:34,248
This isn't your mind, is it?

1546
02:12:36,849 --> 02:12:39,153
This isn't you at all.

1547
02:12:40,820 --> 02:12:43,257
You're just the bait.

1548
02:12:46,560 --> 02:12:47,760
Enough!

1549
02:12:51,030 --> 02:12:52,031
Run.

1550
02:12:54,334 --> 02:12:57,068
How the hell did we miss you?

1551
02:12:58,438 --> 02:12:59,971
Oh...

1552
02:12:59,973 --> 02:13:02,408
You and I should have
met years ago.

1553
02:13:05,812 --> 02:13:06,813
Danny.

1554
02:13:08,181 --> 02:13:11,983
That's your name, isn't it?

1555
02:13:11,985 --> 02:13:13,517
Well, something happens
to the steam

1556
02:13:13,519 --> 02:13:15,586
when you rubes get older.

1557
02:13:15,588 --> 02:13:17,854
It gets polluted.

1558
02:13:17,856 --> 02:13:19,457
Dirty.

1559
02:13:19,459 --> 02:13:20,759
You know that.

1560
02:13:21,927 --> 02:13:24,828
I see the grease all over you.

1561
02:13:24,830 --> 02:13:27,598
You don't shine
quite the same.

1562
02:13:27,600 --> 02:13:30,169
Growing up spoils that,
I guess.

1563
02:13:32,272 --> 02:13:34,438
Seriously, handsome,

1564
02:13:34,440 --> 02:13:37,109
where have you been hiding?

1565
02:13:40,045 --> 02:13:42,114
I can make you an offer.

1566
02:13:43,248 --> 02:13:45,115
An offer I rarely make.

1567
02:13:45,117 --> 02:13:47,618
Oh, yeah? I can't wait.

1568
02:13:47,620 --> 02:13:49,286
Such a gifted boy,

1569
02:13:49,288 --> 02:13:53,423
hiding his light
under a bushel for so long.

1570
02:13:53,425 --> 02:13:57,961
You could live a long,
long time. Live well, too.

1571
02:13:57,963 --> 02:14:02,198
Indulge yourself,
no consequences,

1572
02:14:02,200 --> 02:14:03,235
no hangovers.

1573
02:14:05,637 --> 02:14:08,405
Eat well, live long.

1574
02:14:08,407 --> 02:14:11,308
You must be lonely,
being the last one.

1575
02:14:11,310 --> 02:14:13,510
I mean,
the last one in the world.

1576
02:14:13,512 --> 02:14:16,148
Sweetie, I'm not the last.
Far from it.

1577
02:14:17,282 --> 02:14:19,148
I'm just the prettiest.

1578
02:14:19,150 --> 02:14:21,218
I assume you know my answer.

1579
02:14:22,987 --> 02:14:24,119
Pity.

1580
02:14:24,121 --> 02:14:25,890
So, are we doing this or not?

1581
02:14:42,406 --> 02:14:44,039
Whew.

1582
02:14:46,277 --> 02:14:48,610
Oh, sweetie.

1583
02:14:48,612 --> 02:14:52,381
Oh, look at that, huh?

1584
02:14:52,383 --> 02:14:56,585
I seem to have nicked
your femoral artery there.

1585
02:14:56,587 --> 02:14:59,321
Why, you're gonna
bleed to death, huh?

1586
02:15:05,028 --> 02:15:07,061
My, my,
what a temper you have.

1587
02:15:07,063 --> 02:15:08,164
So much fire.

1588
02:15:09,032 --> 02:15:10,599
Such a waste!

1589
02:15:10,601 --> 02:15:12,266
Or maybe not.

1590
02:15:19,309 --> 02:15:21,643
Oh, damn.

1591
02:15:21,645 --> 02:15:24,245
Even at your age...

1592
02:15:24,247 --> 02:15:25,949
it's so good.

1593
02:15:31,020 --> 02:15:33,022
You taste like whiskey.

1594
02:15:38,228 --> 02:15:39,629
Danny!

1595
02:15:40,497 --> 02:15:41,931
Danny boy!

1596
02:15:43,066 --> 02:15:45,500
Oh, so much terror.

1597
02:15:45,502 --> 02:15:47,268
All your life, huh?

1598
02:15:49,572 --> 02:15:51,341
Delicious.

1599
02:15:57,212 --> 02:15:59,582
Don't hurt me!

1600
02:16:01,317 --> 02:16:02,317
Oh, damn.

1601
02:16:07,089 --> 02:16:08,388
What are...
You're not alone in there.

1602
02:16:08,390 --> 02:16:09,592
Huh?

1603
02:16:10,627 --> 02:16:12,127
What are you hiding, huh?

1604
02:16:14,396 --> 02:16:16,296
What's in those?

1605
02:16:16,298 --> 02:16:17,732
Something special, huh?

1606
02:16:17,734 --> 02:16:21,336
They're not special.
They're starving.

1607
02:16:30,279 --> 02:16:31,445
No.

1608
02:16:31,447 --> 02:16:33,447
No!

1609
02:17:10,384 --> 02:17:12,318
Hello, Danny.

1610
02:17:14,288 --> 02:17:16,691
Come and play with us...

1611
02:17:17,792 --> 02:17:19,458
forever...

1612
02:17:19,460 --> 02:17:22,129
...and ever...

1613
02:17:23,231 --> 02:17:25,099
and ever.

1614
02:17:59,399 --> 02:18:01,733
Uncle Dan.

1615
02:18:01,735 --> 02:18:03,501
Uncle Dan, is it done?

1616
02:18:03,503 --> 02:18:05,772
Is she dead?

1617
02:18:27,761 --> 02:18:30,294
Great party, isn't it?

1618
02:18:30,296 --> 02:18:31,598
Abra!

1619
02:18:35,301 --> 02:18:36,670
Abra!

1620
02:18:52,851 --> 02:18:54,386
Abra!

1621
02:19:00,693 --> 02:19:02,261
Abra!

1622
02:19:20,679 --> 02:19:22,146
Try it.

1623
02:19:25,183 --> 02:19:26,549
Oh, there you are.

1624
02:19:26,551 --> 02:19:27,786
Abra.

1625
02:19:28,921 --> 02:19:31,688
You've been very, very bad.

1626
02:19:31,690 --> 02:19:33,857
You're not Uncle Dan.

1627
02:19:33,859 --> 02:19:38,194
You're a mask. A false face.

1628
02:19:38,196 --> 02:19:39,428
Who else would I be?

1629
02:19:39,430 --> 02:19:40,431
You're the hotel.

1630
02:19:41,299 --> 02:19:42,698
But he's still in there.

1631
02:19:42,700 --> 02:19:44,469
Mask is off, then.

1632
02:19:49,240 --> 02:19:51,340
Why are you smiling?

1633
02:19:51,342 --> 02:19:53,509
Because you don't know
where you're standing.

1634
02:19:53,511 --> 02:19:57,446
I know these halls
like my own face, child.

1635
02:19:57,448 --> 02:19:59,649
I mean the body
you're standing in.

1636
02:19:59,651 --> 02:20:01,350
The face you're wearing.

1637
02:20:01,352 --> 02:20:03,586
That's Dan Torrance,
and you don't know him.

1638
02:20:03,588 --> 02:20:05,387
Dan Torrance.

1639
02:20:05,389 --> 02:20:06,756
Dan Torrance

1640
02:20:06,758 --> 02:20:09,825
made one stop
as soon as he got here.

1641
02:20:09,827 --> 02:20:11,428
To the boiler room.

1642
02:20:36,353 --> 02:20:39,854
There you are.

1643
02:20:39,856 --> 02:20:41,690
You were supposed to run.

1644
02:20:41,692 --> 02:20:43,391
I didn't wanna leave you.

1645
02:20:46,263 --> 02:20:49,864
I'm exactly where
I'm supposed to be.

1646
02:20:49,866 --> 02:20:51,533
I can't hold it off
for much longer.

1647
02:20:51,535 --> 02:20:52,734
Abra, you need to run.

1648
02:20:52,736 --> 02:20:54,002
No.

1649
02:20:54,004 --> 02:20:55,670
I'm not going anywhere
without you.

1650
02:20:55,672 --> 02:20:58,240
I have to close the door
behind us, right?

1651
02:20:58,975 --> 02:21:00,675
Run! Run!

1652
02:23:14,875 --> 02:23:15,976
Come on, Uncle Dan.

1653
02:23:16,777 --> 02:23:18,045
Get out of there.

1654
02:23:19,479 --> 02:23:20,681
Come on.

1655
02:23:32,125 --> 02:23:34,625
<i>The fire spread fast,</i>

1656
02:23:34,627 --> 02:23:36,627
<i>destroying the hotel.</i>

1657
02:23:36,629 --> 02:23:38,098
<i>Purifying it.</i>

1658
02:23:39,632 --> 02:23:41,699
I could almost hear it

1659
02:23:41,701 --> 02:23:42,970
screaming.

1660
02:23:43,971 --> 02:23:46,637
I could hear it dying.

1661
02:23:46,639 --> 02:23:49,475
And deep inside, I knew...

1662
02:23:52,111 --> 02:23:54,080
I knew you were okay.

1663
02:23:55,548 --> 02:23:58,549
I'm sorry I put you in danger.

1664
02:23:58,551 --> 02:23:59,952
It was the only way.

1665
02:24:00,887 --> 02:24:02,088
I know.

1666
02:24:03,189 --> 02:24:06,590
Do you think she was right

1667
02:24:06,592 --> 02:24:09,827
when she said
she wasn't the last one?

1668
02:24:09,829 --> 02:24:12,062
The world's a hungry place.

1669
02:24:12,064 --> 02:24:14,732
A dark place.

1670
02:24:14,734 --> 02:24:18,568
Maybe there's more of them
or things like them or worse,

1671
02:24:18,570 --> 02:24:21,038
but there are more people
like you, too.

1672
02:24:21,040 --> 02:24:22,808
People who stand.

1673
02:24:26,212 --> 02:24:28,012
I told you
when I first met you...

1674
02:24:28,014 --> 02:24:30,782
I told you
that you should hide.

1675
02:24:32,251 --> 02:24:34,452
That you should
keep your head down.

1676
02:24:35,520 --> 02:24:37,689
Keep your shine out of sight.

1677
02:24:39,258 --> 02:24:40,825
But I was wrong.

1678
02:24:43,995 --> 02:24:46,164
Shine on, Abra Stone.

1679
02:24:48,833 --> 02:24:50,168
You shine on.

1680
02:24:53,104 --> 02:24:54,940
Dinner's ready.

1681
02:24:58,076 --> 02:24:59,911
Who are you talking to?

1682
02:25:01,880 --> 02:25:02,881
No one.

1683
02:25:03,580 --> 02:25:04,581
Hmm.

1684
02:25:11,089 --> 02:25:12,690
That's not true.

1685
02:25:16,660 --> 02:25:18,029
I was talking to Dan.

1686
02:25:25,936 --> 02:25:28,072
We go on after.

1687
02:25:28,939 --> 02:25:30,107
We go on.

1688
02:25:30,874 --> 02:25:32,476
And he's okay.

1689
02:25:33,110 --> 02:25:34,111
So is Daddy.

1690
02:25:35,779 --> 02:25:36,981
He really is.

1691
02:25:40,985 --> 02:25:42,519
Good.

1692
02:25:53,864 --> 02:25:55,165
You coming, sweetheart?

1693
02:25:57,935 --> 02:25:59,269
In a minute.
