2
00:02:38,385 --> 00:02:40,662
Find me

3
00:03:18,744 --> 00:03:20,329
closer

4
00:04:11,767 --> 00:04:13,437
found you!

5
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:17,995
Ah ha!

6
00:04:17,996 --> 00:04:19,558
You think you could hide
from me, did you?

7
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:22,381
Did you read what it said?
It said found you.

8
00:04:22,382 --> 00:04:24,695
- It didn't say tickle...
- Samuel. Bee.

9
00:04:24,696 --> 00:04:26,437
That's enough.

10
00:04:30,205 --> 00:04:33,278
- You don't want to get overheated.
- I'm not.

11
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:34,720
You're sure?

12
00:04:34,721 --> 00:04:36,908
Good.
Because now it's my turn!

13
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:38,871
- Dad, help!
- You need help?

14
00:04:38,872 --> 00:04:40,952
Oh sure, I can
help tickle you.

15
00:04:42,222 --> 00:04:45,307
I think the bottom of this feet
might be very ticklish.

16
00:04:58,202 --> 00:05:00,310
Time for bed, Bee.

17
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:04,892
Thank you.

18
00:05:12,105 --> 00:05:15,039
- Love you Mommy.
- Love you more.

19
00:05:20,373 --> 00:05:21,922
Mommy?

20
00:05:28,167 --> 00:05:31,307
- Just for a little while.
- Thanks.

21
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:01,923
- Mommy.
- Um-hm.

22
00:06:01,924 --> 00:06:04,227
Can we play dollies
when we get home?

23
00:06:04,228 --> 00:06:07,393
Well, I think if you help me
with the washing up

24
00:06:07,394 --> 00:06:10,798
- I can play dollies with you all afternoon.
- Sam.

25
00:06:10,799 --> 00:06:11,706
Yes!

26
00:06:11,707 --> 00:06:12,939
Sam.

27
00:06:13,757 --> 00:06:14,809
Good morning, Sam.

28
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:16,188
- Good morning, Esther.
- Morning.

29
00:06:16,189 --> 00:06:18,148
Hey there, busy Bee.

30
00:06:18,516 --> 00:06:20,110
Sam, just wondering...

31
00:06:20,135 --> 00:06:21,912
if you got that order
of mine ready yet?

32
00:06:21,913 --> 00:06:24,342
I got customers coming
into my store everyday

33
00:06:24,343 --> 00:06:26,055
asking about your dolls.

34
00:06:26,056 --> 00:06:28,472
You can send your son
over tomorrow, Vic.

35
00:06:28,473 --> 00:06:29,638
They're ready.

36
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:30,674
Well, hallelujah.

37
00:06:30,675 --> 00:06:33,028
I guess prayers do
get answered, don't they?

38
00:06:33,029 --> 00:06:34,025
They do.

39
00:06:34,026 --> 00:06:36,515
Oh right... well, thank you so much.
You all have a good Sunday.

40
00:06:36,516 --> 00:06:38,860
- You have a good day too.
- You have a lovely day.

41
00:06:40,809 --> 00:06:42,299
In you get.

42
00:06:45,332 --> 00:06:46,821
Damn it!

43
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:48,786
Language.

44
00:06:52,962 --> 00:06:54,948
There's a car coming,
why don't I wave it down

45
00:06:54,949 --> 00:06:56,377
and see if we can
get some help.

46
00:06:56,378 --> 00:06:58,340
No, no, no, no.
I got it.

47
00:07:06,556 --> 00:07:07,997
I'll get it.

48
00:07:12,434 --> 00:07:14,146
BEE!

49
00:07:14,147 --> 00:07:15,803
No!

54
00:08:02,378 --> 00:08:04,958
Okay.
Pick a number.

55
00:08:05,821 --> 00:08:07,313
Linda?

56
00:08:08,038 --> 00:08:09,704
Um.

57
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:11,889
Four.

58
00:08:11,914 --> 00:08:13,438
Okay.

59
00:08:14,209 --> 00:08:16,908
You will soon make new friends.

60
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:19,550
Do my now.

61
00:08:22,414 --> 00:08:24,066
What's wrong?

62
00:08:25,349 --> 00:08:27,732
I just wish you and me
were going to a new home

63
00:08:27,733 --> 00:08:29,982
instead of a new orphanage.

64
00:08:30,585 --> 00:08:32,793
Sweet Sue thinks too.

65
00:08:36,515 --> 00:08:38,843
It would be nice
to have a home.

66
00:08:38,844 --> 00:08:41,442
Yeah, but...
only if you're there.

67
00:08:41,443 --> 00:08:44,047
I don't want to go
anywhere you're not.

68
00:08:46,001 --> 00:08:47,608
So, let's swear.

69
00:08:47,609 --> 00:08:51,072
If someone wants one of us,
they get both of us.

70
00:08:51,277 --> 00:08:54,078
Okay.
I swear.

71
00:08:54,079 --> 00:08:55,404
Good.

72
00:08:55,806 --> 00:08:57,349
Me too.

73
00:08:58,178 --> 00:09:00,869
You know what I like most
about Sweet Sue?

74
00:09:01,098 --> 00:09:02,488
What?

75
00:09:04,141 --> 00:09:06,236
She looks just like you.

76
00:09:08,971 --> 00:09:11,413
So, how much further
is it, father?

77
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:15,491
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
You're worse than the children, sister.

78
00:09:16,712 --> 00:09:20,566
The Mullins agreeing to take
us in was a gift from god.

79
00:09:20,567 --> 00:09:23,990
What kind of person isn't
excited about getting a gift?

80
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:26,466
I should mention
don't be alarm if you...

81
00:09:26,467 --> 00:09:29,155
don't see much of
Mrs Mullins at first.

82
00:09:29,156 --> 00:09:31,663
She... has a condition.

83
00:09:31,664 --> 00:09:36,116
You see, she was in
an accident years ago.

84
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:39,322
You girls would do well
to help her if need be.

85
00:10:50,265 --> 00:10:53,361
Janice.
You need help?

86
00:10:53,362 --> 00:10:56,079
No, thanks.
I can manage.

87
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:02,943
Sister.

88
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:07,516
She's one of the unfortunate ones
with that polio outbreak,

89
00:11:07,517 --> 00:11:10,313
but she's getting stronger everyday.

90
00:11:10,314 --> 00:11:13,094
She won't be a burden,
I promise you.

91
00:11:13,095 --> 00:11:14,301
Um-hm.

92
00:11:14,302 --> 00:11:18,018
Mr Mullins, why don't
you show the girls around?

93
00:11:18,262 --> 00:11:20,775
I can unload their belongings.

94
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,215
We'll start inside.

95
00:11:23,361 --> 00:11:25,197
Thank you, father.

96
00:11:34,004 --> 00:11:36,928
Wow.
This is an amazing castle.

97
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:39,552
Which obviously makes us the princesses.

98
00:11:39,577 --> 00:11:41,010
This is our new orphanage?

99
00:11:41,035 --> 00:11:43,829
I think this is fine if
we're never being adopted.

100
00:11:46,495 --> 00:11:47,794
There's a TV.

101
00:11:47,795 --> 00:11:52,166
The television no longer works,
the radio however does.

102
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:00,016
This goes on forever.

103
00:12:00,017 --> 00:12:02,918
You're right. We're going to need
a map to find our way around.

104
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:05,224
Girls, this way.

105
00:12:06,678 --> 00:12:09,308
As you can see, the dining room
is more than adequate

106
00:12:09,309 --> 00:12:11,572
to accommodate all of us.

107
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:15,319
Wow.
Look here.

108
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,234
Let's stay together.

109
00:12:24,631 --> 00:12:27,299
Mrs Mullins and I stay in here.

110
00:12:27,523 --> 00:12:31,072
Fell free to use the rest of the
downstairs as you see fit.

111
00:12:31,097 --> 00:12:33,406
Your rooms are upstairs.

112
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,970
Mr Mullins.

113
00:12:34,971 --> 00:12:39,016
Is there someway Janice and I
can maybe stay down here?

114
00:12:39,119 --> 00:12:40,691
Me too.

115
00:12:40,776 --> 00:12:42,425
I'll be fine.

116
00:12:56,782 --> 00:12:59,437
I installed it years ago
for my wife.

117
00:12:59,438 --> 00:13:03,540
Hasn't been used in ages,
but it works fine.

118
00:13:03,929 --> 00:13:05,726
Try it, Jan.

119
00:13:07,472 --> 00:13:09,639
If you don't, I will.

120
00:13:14,704 --> 00:13:16,144
Up is up

121
00:13:16,169 --> 00:13:17,850
Down is down.

122
00:13:17,851 --> 00:13:19,792
But it won't work...

123
00:13:21,199 --> 00:13:24,139
... unless you click the seat belt in.

124
00:13:24,802 --> 00:13:26,340
Like this.

125
00:13:28,293 --> 00:13:29,874
Simple.

126
00:13:41,055 --> 00:13:42,669
Thank you.

127
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:42,269
I get to go next!

128
00:14:55,961 --> 00:14:57,948
Wow.
Nice.

129
00:14:57,973 --> 00:15:00,645
I guess this is ours.

130
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:04,975
Let's take that side.

131
00:15:04,976 --> 00:15:07,200
Kate and Tierney can have these.

132
00:15:07,201 --> 00:15:09,577
What about Linda and me?

133
00:15:09,883 --> 00:15:13,665
Relax, Janice. This is a big house,
there are other bedrooms.

134
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:15,675
Why can't Linda and me
have those over there?

135
00:15:15,676 --> 00:15:19,501
Okay, but then,
where would Kate and Tierney sleep?

136
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:27,666
Wow.

137
00:15:27,771 --> 00:15:29,254
This is neat.

138
00:15:29,255 --> 00:15:30,790
I got this one.

139
00:15:57,796 --> 00:15:59,188
Locked.

140
00:15:59,527 --> 00:16:01,875
And it stays that way too.

141
00:16:10,607 --> 00:16:13,429
Hey, Jan.
In here.

142
00:16:41,281 --> 00:16:42,649
Hey.

143
00:16:43,719 --> 00:16:46,141
You wanna bunk beds?

144
00:18:03,084 --> 00:18:05,716
- Hey sister Charlotte, can we...
- Oh lord.

145
00:18:05,741 --> 00:18:10,239
Please bless Nancy with the wisdom
to not give people their heart attacks.

146
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,605
Sorry.

147
00:18:11,636 --> 00:18:12,980
What is your emergency?

148
00:18:12,981 --> 00:18:14,265
Can we go exploring?

149
00:18:14,266 --> 00:18:16,277
Help father Massey with
your things first and then...

150
00:18:16,278 --> 00:18:17,885
But Mr Mullins insist that we go.

151
00:18:17,886 --> 00:18:20,146
- But that doesn't mean you don't have to...
- You know how father Massey is.

152
00:18:20,147 --> 00:18:22,277
We'll only get in the way.

153
00:18:24,007 --> 00:18:26,323
- Fine.
- She said okay!

154
00:18:26,324 --> 00:18:28,531
But look out for one another.

155
00:18:33,021 --> 00:18:34,811
You coming, Jan?

156
00:18:34,975 --> 00:18:36,870
Maybe in a little while.

157
00:18:38,552 --> 00:18:40,003
Well.

158
00:18:40,692 --> 00:18:42,551
Maybe I'll stay too.

159
00:18:42,748 --> 00:18:45,045
Because you feel sorry for me?

160
00:18:45,848 --> 00:18:47,032
Well...

161
00:18:47,033 --> 00:18:50,321
You promised you wouldn't
treat me any differently.

162
00:18:50,358 --> 00:18:51,839
Okay.

163
00:18:52,656 --> 00:18:54,256
See ya!

164
00:20:34,035 --> 00:20:38,040
Dear lord.
Thank you for bringing us all together.

165
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:41,679
Bless this food for our use,

166
00:20:42,078 --> 00:20:44,413
and us to thy service.

167
00:20:45,382 --> 00:20:48,439
Fill our hearts with grateful praise.

168
00:20:48,815 --> 00:20:52,677
And help us give you
glory each day through

169
00:20:54,504 --> 00:20:57,290
Jesus Christ our Lord.
Amen.

170
00:20:57,291 --> 00:20:58,691
- Amen.
- Amen.

171
00:21:09,995 --> 00:21:12,034
If you'd excuse me.

172
00:21:46,997 --> 00:21:48,529
Carol.

173
00:21:54,488 --> 00:21:56,832
Keep to your own business.

174
00:22:08,632 --> 00:22:13,706
And if I die before I wake,
I pray the lord my soul to take.

175
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:15,987
Please, god.
Help Linda and me find a good home

176
00:22:15,988 --> 00:22:17,431
and keeps us together.

177
00:22:17,432 --> 00:22:21,205
- So we finally be real sisters.
- With good loving parents.

178
00:22:21,206 --> 00:22:23,798
That hate homework
because we do.

179
00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:28,059
But, even if they don't,
that's okay too.

180
00:22:28,395 --> 00:22:30,275
Amen.

181
00:23:18,006 --> 00:23:20,660
Find me

182
00:23:57,243 --> 00:23:58,835
in here

183
00:24:08,615 --> 00:24:10,194
Nancy.

184
00:24:11,226 --> 00:24:12,694
Carol.

185
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:15,554
Are you guys in here?

186
00:24:19,591 --> 00:24:24,270
Forgive me, Father,
for I am about to sin.

187
00:31:05,051 --> 00:31:08,521
I think this is where
Mr Mullins keeps his wife.

188
00:31:08,819 --> 00:31:10,399
Does she really wear a mask?

189
00:31:10,424 --> 00:31:12,862
Yeah, she looked like a doll.

190
00:31:13,864 --> 00:31:15,788
Mrs Mullins?

191
00:31:15,872 --> 00:31:17,244
You down there?

192
00:31:17,245 --> 00:31:18,570
Stop it.

193
00:31:19,234 --> 00:31:21,312
I think he seems nice.

194
00:31:21,467 --> 00:31:24,339
Why don't you go find Janice,
see what she's up to.

195
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,458
Why?

196
00:31:25,459 --> 00:31:27,305
So you can talk about boys.

197
00:31:27,306 --> 00:31:29,975
Well, do you want to
talk about boys?

198
00:31:30,187 --> 00:31:32,978
Gross.
No.

199
00:31:33,035 --> 00:31:34,411
I want to play a game.

200
00:31:34,412 --> 00:31:35,764
Okay.

201
00:31:35,765 --> 00:31:37,273
Let's play hide and seek.

202
00:31:37,274 --> 00:31:39,673
You go hide and
we'll come look for you.

203
00:31:39,674 --> 00:31:41,115
Okay.

204
00:31:46,311 --> 00:31:49,317
So, are we going to
look for her?

205
00:31:49,498 --> 00:31:51,079
Maybe.

206
00:31:56,987 --> 00:31:58,574
Bless you.

207
00:31:58,575 --> 00:32:00,012
Thank you.

208
00:32:00,663 --> 00:32:02,133
What are you doing?

209
00:32:02,134 --> 00:32:05,458
I asked Mr Mullins if we could use
this room for our new classroom

210
00:32:05,459 --> 00:32:07,863
and he graciously agreed.

211
00:32:07,864 --> 00:32:09,732
Would you like to help?

212
00:32:11,835 --> 00:32:13,480
What's wrong?

213
00:32:14,772 --> 00:32:17,208
I have a sin to confess.

214
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:21,734
Forgive me, sister Charlotte,
for I have sinned.

215
00:32:22,294 --> 00:32:25,332
-  It's been...
- At least 2 weeks.

216
00:32:26,341 --> 00:32:28,924
... at least 2 weeks
since my last confession.

217
00:32:31,063 --> 00:32:33,479
There's this room upstairs
I'm not suppose to go into.

218
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,295
But you did anyway.

219
00:32:36,269 --> 00:32:37,509
How did you know?

220
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:40,963
Because otherwise why would
you be telling me about it.

221
00:32:42,594 --> 00:32:45,405
Well, the door was already opened.

222
00:32:46,024 --> 00:32:49,672
I don't know how because
Mr Mullins always keeps it locked.

223
00:32:50,242 --> 00:32:52,481
When I went inside
there was this little doll.

224
00:32:52,482 --> 00:32:54,787
- And it was really strange.
- Janice.

225
00:32:54,928 --> 00:32:56,558
Weird things started to happen.

226
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:59,142
Janice, listen to yourself.

227
00:33:00,317 --> 00:33:02,777
What do I always say?

228
00:33:03,575 --> 00:33:06,981
A sin is a sin
no matter the context.

229
00:33:08,007 --> 00:33:12,528
More importantly, you absolutely
cannot disobey the Mullins.

230
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:16,783
We only just got here and
they're doing a very generous thing

231
00:33:16,784 --> 00:33:19,286
by allowing us
to stay with them.

232
00:33:20,734 --> 00:33:23,594
If they decide to
no longer have us here...

233
00:33:23,595 --> 00:33:25,536
we'll all be split up.

234
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:29,258
So next time you're thinking
of breaking a rule,

235
00:33:29,494 --> 00:33:33,965
think of how that could've affect
the other girls first.

236
00:33:35,962 --> 00:33:37,249
Do you understand me?

237
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:39,203
Yes.
I'm sorry, sister, I wasn't thinking.

238
00:33:39,204 --> 00:33:40,790
It's okay, love.

239
00:33:43,145 --> 00:33:46,273
For your penance,
pray 1 Hail Mary

240
00:33:46,354 --> 00:33:49,766
and unpack 3 of these boxes.

241
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:56,310
What are you guys doing?

242
00:33:57,087 --> 00:33:59,072
Unpacking boxes.

243
00:33:59,442 --> 00:34:00,730
Oh.

244
00:34:47,864 --> 00:34:49,980
This place is so creepy.

245
00:35:03,648 --> 00:35:05,161
What was that?

246
00:35:10,495 --> 00:35:12,211
What was that?

247
00:35:18,235 --> 00:35:20,512
How dare you!

248
00:35:23,767 --> 00:35:26,040
Oh, Mr Scarecrow.

249
00:36:36,984 --> 00:36:38,289
Oh.

250
00:36:39,183 --> 00:36:40,740
Found you.

251
00:36:41,078 --> 00:36:43,381
You're not very good at hiding.

252
00:36:48,821 --> 00:36:52,153
Years of neglect have
affected the counter balance.

253
00:36:52,387 --> 00:36:54,998
There.
That should keep the draft out.

254
00:36:54,999 --> 00:36:56,549
Thank you.

255
00:37:05,433 --> 00:37:07,398
That was taken in Romania.

256
00:37:07,399 --> 00:37:09,716
At a convent of cloistered nuns.

257
00:37:09,717 --> 00:37:11,525
They have little contact
with the outside world

258
00:37:11,526 --> 00:37:14,398
but I became very close
to these three.

259
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:17,670
That's sister Maria.
That's sister Anna.

260
00:37:17,671 --> 00:37:19,804
And that's sister Lucia.

261
00:37:21,217 --> 00:37:22,998
Who's this?

262
00:37:23,384 --> 00:37:24,520
!! Valak !!

263
00:37:25,667 --> 00:37:28,692
I... don't know.
I don't think I even met her.

264
00:37:31,613 --> 00:37:33,337
Is there anything else you need?

265
00:37:33,362 --> 00:37:35,181
No.
Thank you.

266
00:37:39,144 --> 00:37:40,639
Good night.

267
00:37:42,992 --> 00:37:44,521
Good night.

268
00:37:47,622 --> 00:37:49,520
Uuu.
I like him.

269
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:51,454
Which one would you marry?

270
00:37:51,455 --> 00:37:53,146
Oh.
I don't know.

271
00:37:53,147 --> 00:37:56,256
I guess I'll just have to date
all of them to find out.

272
00:37:56,577 --> 00:37:58,577
How do you like his eyebrows?

273
00:37:59,128 --> 00:38:01,406
- His eye.
- Ain't he handsome?

274
00:38:26,127 --> 00:38:29,713
Night time is when Mrs Mullins
gets her powers.

275
00:38:29,714 --> 00:38:32,300
That's why she's in bed all day.
But at night...

276
00:38:32,301 --> 00:38:34,296
she can go wherever she wants.

277
00:38:34,297 --> 00:38:38,168
She needs to
so she can feed.

278
00:38:38,193 --> 00:38:40,762
And if you look directly
at her you'll die.

279
00:38:40,763 --> 00:38:42,904
And to get you to look,
she'll keep saying your name

280
00:38:42,905 --> 00:38:47,755
over and over
till you can't stand it!

281
00:38:49,814 --> 00:38:53,041
Nancy.
Nancy.

282
00:38:53,042 --> 00:38:55,313
- Nancy...
- No. No.

283
00:38:55,338 --> 00:38:56,791
Nancy.

284
00:39:13,923 --> 00:39:15,159
No.

285
00:39:15,738 --> 00:39:17,656
She's ready to feed.

286
00:39:18,195 --> 00:39:21,064
Carol.
Carol.

287
00:39:21,065 --> 00:39:22,115
Carol.

288
00:39:22,116 --> 00:39:23,481
Hey, we're not suppose to be up.

289
00:39:23,482 --> 00:39:25,849
- Well, you'll do it to.
- Hey.

290
00:39:34,657 --> 00:39:37,141
Why isn't he answering her?

291
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:09,919
- It's her.
- Don't look at her.

292
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,066
No!

293
00:40:11,067 --> 00:40:14,462
No.
Please please please...

294
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,164
Please.

295
00:40:17,981 --> 00:40:19,186
Please.

296
00:40:27,517 --> 00:40:29,014
She's gone.

297
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:32,824
She's gone.
She's gone.

298
00:40:35,451 --> 00:40:37,051
What's going on?

299
00:40:37,052 --> 00:40:38,222
What on god's earth?

300
00:40:38,247 --> 00:40:39,799
- Sister Charlotte.
- Mrs Mullins.

301
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:40,882
She was here.
We heard.

302
00:40:40,883 --> 00:40:43,208
In this room,
she was standing right over there.

303
00:40:43,209 --> 00:40:44,547
Who?

304
00:40:45,496 --> 00:40:47,215
Your wife apparently.

305
00:40:47,216 --> 00:40:48,961
They said she was
just in here.

306
00:40:48,962 --> 00:40:50,595
Oh, that's impossible.

307
00:40:50,596 --> 00:40:53,913
My wife hasn't been
able to walk for years.

308
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:19,293
Girls.
Girls.

309
00:41:20,277 --> 00:41:22,958
Let's go back to our studies, okay?

310
00:41:36,134 --> 00:41:38,139
You okay, Nance?

311
00:41:48,919 --> 00:41:51,721
Did you really see Mrs Mullins
in your room last night?

312
00:41:51,722 --> 00:41:53,570
Yes.
We swear we were under the cover and...

313
00:41:53,571 --> 00:41:55,611
Nancy.
Stop it.

314
00:41:55,612 --> 00:41:58,761
We just freaked ourselves out
last night, you know that.

315
00:42:14,952 --> 00:42:16,641
Mrs Mullins?

316
00:42:17,103 --> 00:42:18,959
Sister Charlotte.

317
00:42:18,984 --> 00:42:22,034
Could I trouble you
for a glass of water?

318
00:42:22,059 --> 00:42:23,829
Of course.

319
00:42:59,206 --> 00:43:01,830
It's good to hear
some life again.

320
00:43:02,363 --> 00:43:07,154
I've been cooped up here so long
I forgotten what that sounded like.

321
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:11,022
What a lovely picture.

322
00:43:11,023 --> 00:43:13,067
She was taken from us

323
00:43:13,068 --> 00:43:16,410
at an early age... unfortunately.

324
00:43:17,799 --> 00:43:20,514
If you could turn away
for a moment, sister.

325
00:43:20,515 --> 00:43:22,261
Yes, of course.

326
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,274
I'm very sorry to hear
about your daughter.

327
00:43:29,448 --> 00:43:33,786
But we find comfort in knowing
she waits for you in heaven.

328
00:43:34,116 --> 00:43:36,539
I wish that were true.

329
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,937
Oh my gosh.

330
00:45:31,962 --> 00:45:34,305
You shouldn't be in here.

331
00:45:34,347 --> 00:45:36,436
Well, neither should you.

332
00:45:47,410 --> 00:45:49,540
Who's room is this anyways?

333
00:45:49,541 --> 00:45:51,480
The Mullins had a daughter.

334
00:45:51,481 --> 00:45:53,236
It was her's.

335
00:45:55,418 --> 00:45:57,080
Had one?

336
00:45:57,601 --> 00:45:59,645
I think she died.

337
00:46:02,028 --> 00:46:04,936
And I think that was her
playing the music too.

338
00:46:10,179 --> 00:46:12,037
Stop trying to scare me.

339
00:46:12,038 --> 00:46:13,952
I'm not.
It's the truth.

340
00:46:13,953 --> 00:46:15,912
Then why are we in here?

341
00:46:15,913 --> 00:46:17,947
- We should leave.
- No.

342
00:46:18,577 --> 00:46:19,777
Oh.

343
00:46:31,553 --> 00:46:33,016
Linda.

344
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:34,847
What is it?

345
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:38,416
We shouldn't be in here.

346
00:46:40,325 --> 00:46:41,709
Okay.

347
00:46:42,775 --> 00:46:44,548
I'll leave in a minute.

348
00:46:44,549 --> 00:46:46,306
Well, I'm going.

349
00:47:17,031 --> 00:47:20,539
Dear Diary, today I came home

350
00:47:55,251 --> 00:47:56,871
Who's doing that?

351
00:48:47,806 --> 00:48:49,304
Hi.

352
00:49:03,163 --> 00:49:06,550
You're the Mullins' daughter...
aren't you?

353
00:49:08,984 --> 00:49:11,257
What happened to you?

354
00:49:11,453 --> 00:49:13,447
Will you help me?

355
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:18,178
What do you need?

356
00:49:21,588 --> 00:49:24,002
YOUR SOUL!

357
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:46,493
Charlotte!

358
00:49:46,494 --> 00:49:48,824
Sister Charlotte!

359
00:51:00,010 --> 00:51:01,318
No.

360
00:53:03,376 --> 00:53:05,216
How do you feel?

361
00:53:06,265 --> 00:53:08,079
Give her some space.

362
00:53:12,265 --> 00:53:13,782
Girls.

363
00:53:14,769 --> 00:53:16,537
Janice is feeling
a little down right now.

364
00:53:16,538 --> 00:53:19,531
So, we need to do
what we can to support her.

365
00:53:19,979 --> 00:53:22,739
Time I think
is all she needs.

366
00:53:23,022 --> 00:53:26,163
She'll walk again, right?

367
00:53:26,951 --> 00:53:28,782
We'll have to see.

368
00:53:30,492 --> 00:53:31,849
You need sleep.

369
00:53:31,850 --> 00:53:34,514
That's going to help you
with the healing.

370
00:53:34,813 --> 00:53:37,399
I can't stay here, sister Charlotte.

371
00:53:38,176 --> 00:53:40,019
We can't stay here.

372
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:41,786
We need to leave.

373
00:53:41,801 --> 00:53:43,280
Leave?

374
00:53:43,305 --> 00:53:45,042
And go where?

375
00:53:47,603 --> 00:53:50,399
There isn't anywhere else
for us to go.

376
00:53:51,084 --> 00:53:54,022
I didn't fall down those stairs.

377
00:53:54,659 --> 00:53:56,738
Something threw me.

378
00:53:57,173 --> 00:53:59,149
What do you mean?

379
00:54:01,641 --> 00:54:03,571
You always say that

380
00:54:03,678 --> 00:54:06,579
even though we can't see god
we can...

381
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:08,926
we can feel his presence.

382
00:54:09,489 --> 00:54:10,946
Well...

383
00:54:11,293 --> 00:54:15,341
in this house I feel
a different kind of presence.

384
00:54:15,446 --> 00:54:17,095
What kind?

385
00:54:21,134 --> 00:54:23,186
An evil one.

386
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:25,233
It's coming after me.

387
00:54:25,234 --> 00:54:26,676
Coming after my soul.

388
00:54:26,677 --> 00:54:28,213
You soul?

389
00:54:28,214 --> 00:54:30,315
Because I'm the weakest.

390
00:54:30,316 --> 00:54:32,141
No, darling.

391
00:54:32,358 --> 00:54:33,755
Listen.

392
00:54:33,834 --> 00:54:36,573
The devil preys on
those weak in faith,

393
00:54:36,574 --> 00:54:39,156
not weak of flesh and bone.

394
00:54:39,252 --> 00:54:42,838
You are as strong
as any of us, Janice.

395
00:54:44,188 --> 00:54:45,866
Stronger.

396
00:55:02,509 --> 00:55:04,953
You're quiet, Samuel.

397
00:55:05,917 --> 00:55:08,238
I think it was a mistake...

398
00:55:08,839 --> 00:55:10,929
to bring the girls here.

399
00:55:12,139 --> 00:55:13,716
Why?

400
00:55:15,806 --> 00:55:17,593
The girl ...

401
00:55:18,045 --> 00:55:20,020
The girl that fell.

402
00:55:20,987 --> 00:55:23,055
Maybe she didn't fall.

403
00:55:23,588 --> 00:55:25,221
Maybe...

404
00:55:25,868 --> 00:55:27,808
It was an accident.

405
00:55:28,507 --> 00:55:30,375
That's all it was.

406
00:55:30,614 --> 00:55:32,782
Accidents happen.

407
00:55:36,877 --> 00:55:40,209
It's been quiet for 12 years.

408
00:55:41,777 --> 00:55:45,457
You should try embracing
the presence of the girls...

409
00:55:45,907 --> 00:55:48,770
instead of frightening them away.

410
00:55:52,894 --> 00:55:55,074
You'll be better soon.

411
00:55:55,075 --> 00:55:57,152
I don't think so.

412
00:55:58,976 --> 00:56:00,792
Not this time.

413
00:56:01,123 --> 00:56:03,060
But you have too.

414
00:56:04,474 --> 00:56:06,933
You said we'll find
a new home.

415
00:56:07,852 --> 00:56:10,275
No one is going to
want me now.

416
00:56:10,276 --> 00:56:12,443
I'll just be a burden.

417
00:56:13,624 --> 00:56:16,245
But you swore we'll stick together.

418
00:56:16,692 --> 00:56:18,559
I take it back.

419
00:56:22,033 --> 00:56:24,619
Maybe I won't get adopted.

420
00:56:28,850 --> 00:56:30,521
You will.

421
00:56:30,575 --> 00:56:32,294
You know why?

422
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:35,006
Because you're special.

423
00:56:36,477 --> 00:56:41,353
You're going to get adopted by
a nice family somewhere

424
00:56:41,354 --> 00:56:44,119
and they're going to
spoil you so much.

425
00:56:44,596 --> 00:56:46,475
You're going to have
so many dolls that...

426
00:56:46,476 --> 00:56:48,809
you won't even be able to
name all of them.

427
00:56:48,810 --> 00:56:50,466
Sure I can.

428
00:56:50,467 --> 00:56:52,156
Janice one.

429
00:56:52,157 --> 00:56:54,737
Janice Two.
Janice Three.

430
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:59,647
Linda.
Time for bed.

431
00:57:01,609 --> 00:57:04,230
Won't you come upstairs?

432
00:57:05,043 --> 00:57:07,273
I don't want to sleep alone.

433
00:57:09,205 --> 00:57:10,637
Here.

434
00:57:11,624 --> 00:57:13,391
Take Becca.

435
00:57:13,687 --> 00:57:15,394
This way,

436
00:57:16,012 --> 00:57:17,997
I'll always be with you.

437
00:57:21,169 --> 00:57:24,356
Then, you should have Sweet Sue.

438
00:57:26,170 --> 00:57:27,807
Thank you.

439
00:57:31,492 --> 00:57:34,277
Remember before
all of this.

440
00:57:34,497 --> 00:57:38,570
When we used to sneak around
the orphanage at night,

441
00:57:38,750 --> 00:57:41,492
And ate all the chocolate
in the pantry.

442
00:57:41,493 --> 00:57:45,433
Father Massey was convinced
that we had mice.

443
00:57:46,241 --> 00:57:51,000
Oh lord, please cleanse
my soul of my sins

444
00:57:51,001 --> 00:57:53,661
and cleanse our house of...

445
00:57:53,662 --> 00:57:56,062
- these mice.
- these mice.

446
00:58:02,515 --> 00:58:04,918
Whatever happens...

447
00:58:06,066 --> 00:58:09,831
I'm thinking always
all those things we did together.

448
00:58:12,487 --> 00:58:14,168
Good night, Linda.

449
00:58:14,555 --> 00:58:16,418
Good night, Janice.

450
01:03:15,870 --> 01:03:18,607
A little sunlight will
do you some good.

451
01:03:18,673 --> 01:03:21,821
I don't the sunlight can fix
what's wrong with me.

452
01:03:22,971 --> 01:03:25,425
You mustn't give up hope.

453
01:03:26,878 --> 01:03:29,401
Hope is a home onto itself.

454
01:03:29,402 --> 01:03:32,398
Dwell in it and it will
protect and keep you.

455
01:03:34,283 --> 01:03:36,604
What book of the bible
is that from?

456
01:03:38,682 --> 01:03:40,421
The book of Charlotte.

457
01:03:41,223 --> 01:03:43,860
But that doesn't
make it any less so.

458
01:03:45,350 --> 01:03:47,147
Are you okay here?

459
01:03:48,676 --> 01:03:50,855
The sunlight actually
feels kind of nice.

460
01:03:50,856 --> 01:03:52,608
I told you.

461
01:04:00,694 --> 01:04:02,195
That's too low.

462
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:31,900
Sister Charlotte?

463
01:04:38,241 --> 01:04:39,960
No, no, no!

464
01:04:40,495 --> 01:04:42,898
No!
Please!

465
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:18,682
Janice!

466
01:06:21,570 --> 01:06:22,997
Janice!

467
01:06:25,260 --> 01:06:26,954
What's going on?

468
01:06:29,528 --> 01:06:31,178
I couldn't get out.

469
01:06:31,179 --> 01:06:33,047
Are you okay?

470
01:06:36,627 --> 01:06:38,340
I'm fine.

471
01:06:45,075 --> 01:06:47,395
I'm worry about Janice.

472
01:06:47,999 --> 01:06:50,093
A few nights ago
she wanted to leave.

473
01:06:50,094 --> 01:06:51,614
Why she want to leave?

474
01:06:51,615 --> 01:06:54,562
Probably because this place
is off the wall.

475
01:06:54,629 --> 01:06:58,199
She told me the Mullins's daughter
was coming for her.

476
01:06:58,224 --> 01:07:00,700
The Mullins' had a daughter?

477
01:07:01,046 --> 01:07:03,508
She died a long time ago.

478
01:07:03,712 --> 01:07:06,099
So, she's seeing ghost?

479
01:07:07,577 --> 01:07:09,433
Keep your voice down.

480
01:07:09,681 --> 01:07:11,890
So, she's seeing ghost?

481
01:07:12,418 --> 01:07:13,991
I guess.

482
01:07:14,369 --> 01:07:17,497
Well...
You guys saw something.

483
01:07:17,684 --> 01:07:19,273
That wasn't a ghost.

484
01:07:19,274 --> 01:07:21,753
Ghost can only be
of dead people.

485
01:07:22,472 --> 01:07:24,938
How does that explain
what you saw?

486
01:07:24,963 --> 01:07:27,641
Unless it really was Mrs Mullins.

487
01:07:28,707 --> 01:07:33,285
Or...
something was just trying to scare you.

488
01:07:33,924 --> 01:07:36,796
You guys are doing a good job
with that on your own.

489
01:07:41,327 --> 01:07:45,762
Janice is probably just looking for ways
to justify us treating her differently.

490
01:07:46,338 --> 01:07:47,963
I don't think so.

491
01:07:47,964 --> 01:07:49,304
Of course you don't.

492
01:07:49,305 --> 01:07:51,454
You'll know what I mean
when you're older.

493
01:07:51,547 --> 01:07:53,578
Now go get to bed.

494
01:08:28,300 --> 01:08:30,215
What are you waiting for?

495
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:31,822
Nothing.

496
01:08:36,024 --> 01:08:37,681
You like it?

497
01:08:38,209 --> 01:08:39,874
It's nice.

498
01:08:44,341 --> 01:08:46,581
It's not my finest work.

499
01:08:57,428 --> 01:08:59,282
You seem troubled.

500
01:09:00,042 --> 01:09:01,770
Maybe I can help.

501
01:09:02,992 --> 01:09:04,899
I don't think so.

502
01:09:04,929 --> 01:09:08,364
Talking about the things
that bothers us sometimes...

503
01:09:09,033 --> 01:09:10,997
all the help we need.

504
01:09:12,286 --> 01:09:13,734
Well...

505
01:09:15,485 --> 01:09:17,477
It's Janice.

506
01:09:17,478 --> 01:09:19,806
She's acting funny.

507
01:09:20,766 --> 01:09:22,612
Acting funny?

508
01:09:23,649 --> 01:09:25,589
She says...

509
01:09:27,328 --> 01:09:29,811
she's seen your daughter.

510
01:09:31,897 --> 01:09:33,639
My daughter...

511
01:09:36,147 --> 01:09:39,411
has been dead for a
very very long time.

512
01:09:41,671 --> 01:09:43,344
I know, but...

513
01:09:43,700 --> 01:09:47,103
You see,
Janice went into her bedroom.

514
01:09:47,104 --> 01:09:48,472
She what?

515
01:09:49,164 --> 01:09:52,023
She knows she wasn't suppose to
but...

516
01:09:52,024 --> 01:09:55,222
- she found this doll and...
- What doll?

517
01:09:55,826 --> 01:09:57,411
The one in the white dress.

518
01:09:57,412 --> 01:09:59,016
That's impossible!

519
01:09:59,017 --> 01:10:01,043
That doll was hidden away.

520
01:10:01,044 --> 01:10:02,955
She mustn't go near that doll!

521
01:10:02,956 --> 01:10:04,673
You understand me?

522
01:11:18,158 --> 01:11:19,858
Found you

523
01:11:31,925 --> 01:11:34,605
Janice, I told you
not to use that room.

524
01:11:34,959 --> 01:11:41,054
Please don't take
my sunshine away...

525
01:12:18,709 --> 01:12:20,749
Ahhh!

526
01:12:20,887 --> 01:12:22,450
Stay here.

527
01:12:24,568 --> 01:12:26,263
Mr Mullins.

528
01:12:31,884 --> 01:12:34,189
Mr Mullins, are you okay?

529
01:12:52,658 --> 01:12:54,756
Go get ready for bed, girls.

530
01:12:54,757 --> 01:12:57,148
I need to speak to Mrs Mullins.

531
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:09,594
Linda.
What are you doing?

532
01:16:09,928 --> 01:16:11,267
This doll.

533
01:16:11,268 --> 01:16:14,392
It's hurting Janice
and it killed Mr Mullins.

534
01:16:14,508 --> 01:16:16,435
I'm getting rid of it!

535
01:16:23,358 --> 01:16:25,398
Linda, let's go back.

536
01:16:40,343 --> 01:16:41,799
Linda?

537
01:16:48,712 --> 01:16:50,301
No!

538
01:17:08,291 --> 01:17:09,245
What is that?

539
01:17:09,270 --> 01:17:11,348
Who cares!
Run!

540
01:17:20,907 --> 01:17:23,513
Janice. Janice.
I got rid of it.

541
01:17:23,538 --> 01:17:25,668
I got rid of the doll.

542
01:17:28,550 --> 01:17:29,970
Janice.

543
01:17:29,971 --> 01:17:31,292
Janice.

544
01:17:31,372 --> 01:17:33,224
- What's going on?
- Where is Janice?

545
01:17:33,225 --> 01:17:35,400
- I don't know.
- Go find her.

546
01:17:35,401 --> 01:17:36,775
Hurry!

547
01:17:42,148 --> 01:17:43,421
What's going on?

548
01:17:43,422 --> 01:17:44,395
No!

549
01:17:44,396 --> 01:17:46,675
No!
Get that thing away from me!

550
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:50,977
It's back.

551
01:17:51,002 --> 01:17:52,963
I know it was back.

552
01:17:52,988 --> 01:17:54,674
What is it?

553
01:17:55,851 --> 01:17:57,313
Evil.

554
01:17:58,072 --> 01:18:00,299
The devil itself.

555
01:18:01,073 --> 01:18:02,837
What are you talking about?

556
01:18:03,968 --> 01:18:07,668
After Samuel and I...
lost our daughter

557
01:18:07,946 --> 01:18:11,327
we prayed and promised
our devotion to

558
01:18:11,328 --> 01:18:13,769
whatever power that
would allow us to

559
01:18:13,770 --> 01:18:17,751
speak or see our
beloved girl again.

560
01:18:18,578 --> 01:18:21,686
It started small,
the contact.

561
01:18:27,316 --> 01:18:29,089
But it was her.

562
01:18:29,468 --> 01:18:31,265
Our busy Bee.

563
01:18:31,454 --> 01:18:33,354
We know it was her.

564
01:18:34,812 --> 01:18:37,553
She wanted permission
to move into the doll

565
01:18:37,554 --> 01:18:40,190
so she could be
with us forever.

566
01:18:50,817 --> 01:18:52,553
please

567
01:18:52,763 --> 01:18:54,558
We said yes.

568
01:18:54,559 --> 01:18:57,722
And that's when it became stronger.

569
01:19:00,440 --> 01:19:03,020
Soon we can actually see her.

570
01:19:03,605 --> 01:19:07,167
Only in fleeting glimpses
but it was enough.

571
01:19:08,242 --> 01:19:10,361
Our beloved Bee.

572
01:19:10,707 --> 01:19:12,248
Our darling.

573
01:19:12,371 --> 01:19:14,152
Annabelle?

574
01:19:22,136 --> 01:19:24,317
Even though I couldn't hold her.

575
01:19:24,318 --> 01:19:28,477
It was comforting to start
the past activity again.

576
01:19:32,593 --> 01:19:36,653
But we soon realised
it wasn't our Annabelle at all.

577
01:19:46,192 --> 01:19:51,941
You are my sunshine,
my only sunshine

578
01:19:52,438 --> 01:19:55,027
You make me happy ...

579
01:19:55,809 --> 01:19:58,190
when skies are gray

580
01:19:59,505 --> 01:20:02,195
You'll never know dear,

581
01:20:02,468 --> 01:20:05,085
how much I love you

582
01:20:05,710 --> 01:20:11,481
Please don't take my sunshine away

583
01:20:38,930 --> 01:20:40,410
Esther?

584
01:20:41,104 --> 01:20:42,564
Esther.

585
01:20:47,082 --> 01:20:49,689
My... eye...

586
01:20:54,991 --> 01:20:57,215
It was a demonic presence.

587
01:20:57,216 --> 01:20:59,876
And it was using our
Annabelle to manipulate us

588
01:20:59,877 --> 01:21:02,585
into giving it soul
it couldn't have.

589
01:21:02,586 --> 01:21:04,653
It tried to take mine.

590
01:21:04,654 --> 01:21:07,530
But Samuel reached out
to the church.

591
01:21:08,307 --> 01:21:09,899
They saved my soul

592
01:21:09,900 --> 01:21:13,328
but the evil was still
attached to that doll.

593
01:21:14,479 --> 01:21:16,835
So we locked it away

594
01:21:16,840 --> 01:21:20,040
where it could be surrounded
by the word of god.

595
01:22:04,079 --> 01:22:07,315
It was quiet
for all these year.

596
01:22:07,384 --> 01:22:10,027
I thought the evil was contained.

597
01:22:11,188 --> 01:22:14,618
We thought helping the girls
could be our penance.

598
01:22:14,813 --> 01:22:18,224
But we end up giving it
just what it wanted.

599
01:22:18,233 --> 01:22:22,897
You are my sunshine,
my only sunshine

600
01:22:22,898 --> 01:22:27,420
You make me happy
when skies are gray

601
01:22:29,151 --> 01:22:31,635
- You'll never know dear,
- Janice.

602
01:22:31,636 --> 01:22:34,145
how much I love you

603
01:22:34,324 --> 01:22:38,025
Please don't take my sunshine away

604
01:22:38,026 --> 01:22:39,761
She can walk.

605
01:22:40,018 --> 01:22:42,176
It's just us, Janice.

606
01:22:43,215 --> 01:22:45,730
Time to cease from sin, Carol.

607
01:22:52,250 --> 01:22:53,993
Sister Charlotte!
Sister Charlotte!

608
01:22:53,994 --> 01:22:55,374
It's-It's Janice.

609
01:22:55,375 --> 01:22:57,129
- She's... She's...
- Look what she did!

610
01:22:57,130 --> 01:22:58,923
- Carol, call for help.
- Okay.

611
01:22:58,924 --> 01:23:01,197
- And stay together.
- Okay.

612
01:23:06,182 --> 01:23:08,871
They're on their way.
Let get somewhere safe.

613
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:14,496
What do we do?

614
01:23:14,497 --> 01:23:17,342
We can't just leave her here,
can we?

615
01:23:28,936 --> 01:23:30,696
Mrs Mullins?

616
01:23:33,107 --> 01:23:34,818
Mrs Mullins?

617
01:23:36,558 --> 01:23:38,408
Mrs Mullins?

618
01:23:56,383 --> 01:23:57,869
Girls.

619
01:23:58,043 --> 01:24:00,388
Let's go.
Now!

620
01:24:03,573 --> 01:24:07,834
Forgive me, sister,
for I have sinned.

621
01:24:37,428 --> 01:24:40,018
- Sister Charlotte! Sister Charlotte!
- Run!

622
01:24:43,731 --> 01:24:45,429
Linda!

623
01:24:47,317 --> 01:24:49,789
Go, Tierney!
Get help!

624
01:24:49,894 --> 01:24:51,487
Or...

625
01:24:51,957 --> 01:24:53,838
... you can help me.

626
01:25:06,024 --> 01:25:07,645
The truck!

627
01:25:08,808 --> 01:25:10,884
Come on.
Come on.

628
01:25:12,484 --> 01:25:14,872
- Close the door! Close the door!
- Come on!

629
01:25:14,873 --> 01:25:16,906
Go!
Go.

630
01:25:23,027 --> 01:25:25,274
- No!
- No! Come on!

631
01:25:28,616 --> 01:25:30,029
Okay.

632
01:25:31,644 --> 01:25:33,395
No!

633
01:25:33,415 --> 01:25:35,340
I'm trying!

634
01:25:43,019 --> 01:25:45,204
- It's not starting!
- I'm trying!

635
01:25:45,229 --> 01:25:46,649
Guys!

636
01:25:49,900 --> 01:25:52,423
- Guys! Guys!
- What? What?

637
01:25:52,921 --> 01:25:54,187
The scarecrow.

638
01:25:54,212 --> 01:25:56,201
What scarecrow?

639
01:25:57,365 --> 01:25:58,572
What...

640
01:26:01,039 --> 01:26:03,091
- Kate.
- Come on!

641
01:26:22,468 --> 01:26:24,435
Come on!
Run!

642
01:26:29,615 --> 01:26:31,095
Carol?

643
01:26:33,929 --> 01:26:35,182
What?

644
01:26:38,075 --> 01:26:39,421
No!
No!

645
01:26:39,629 --> 01:26:42,375
Nancy, I can't get the door open.
Is it locked?

646
01:26:42,376 --> 01:26:44,533
Can you get it from your side?

647
01:26:45,534 --> 01:26:47,071
Girls.

648
01:26:47,786 --> 01:26:49,545
Nancy?

649
01:28:20,805 --> 01:28:21,787
No.

650
01:28:21,788 --> 01:28:23,260
No.
No.

651
01:29:43,243 --> 01:29:45,852
Lord, help me.
Lord, help.

652
01:29:45,877 --> 01:29:47,916
Help...

653
01:29:48,901 --> 01:29:50,366
Carol, it's me.

654
01:29:50,367 --> 01:29:51,811
It's just me.

655
01:29:52,422 --> 01:29:54,065
Now, come on.

656
01:29:59,744 --> 01:30:01,503
Linda.

657
01:32:05,336 --> 01:32:06,995
She's loon.

658
01:32:19,232 --> 01:32:20,583
No!

659
01:32:22,470 --> 01:32:23,902
No!

660
01:33:41,002 --> 01:33:43,094
Sister Charlotte?

661
01:34:09,075 --> 01:34:12,488
You know what I like most
about Sweet Sue?

662
01:34:17,004 --> 01:34:19,654
She looks just like you.

663
01:34:56,866 --> 01:34:58,493
Linda?

664
01:34:59,856 --> 01:35:02,739
Where are you, Linda?

665
01:35:06,083 --> 01:35:07,789
Linda?

666
01:35:18,858 --> 01:35:23,023
Linda, come out and play.

667
01:35:47,855 --> 01:35:49,386
Found you!

668
01:35:51,950 --> 01:35:54,234
You swore if I found a home
you'd come too.

669
01:35:54,235 --> 01:35:56,854
You know what they say
about breaking a swear.

670
01:35:56,855 --> 01:35:58,255
You go straight to hell.

671
01:35:58,280 --> 01:35:59,608
 Janice!

672
01:36:06,281 --> 01:36:07,830
Forgive me.

673
01:36:08,650 --> 01:36:10,052
No!

674
01:36:11,598 --> 01:36:13,125
Let me out!

675
01:36:13,126 --> 01:36:14,926
Let me out!

676
01:36:15,350 --> 01:36:17,780
Let me out... !

677
01:36:59,012 --> 01:37:00,402
Go!

678
01:37:09,397 --> 01:37:11,908
- Sister Charlotte!
- Sister Charlotte!

679
01:38:50,618 --> 01:38:52,254
Anything?

680
01:38:52,478 --> 01:38:54,264
I'm afraid not.

681
01:38:54,501 --> 01:38:56,561
Still no sign of the girl.

682
01:38:56,571 --> 01:38:58,627
But at her age...

683
01:38:58,989 --> 01:39:01,119
how far could she'd gone?

684
01:39:03,148 --> 01:39:04,997
Don't worry.

685
01:39:05,499 --> 01:39:07,278
We'll find her.

686
01:39:14,140 --> 01:39:16,038
This house is blessed.

687
01:39:16,039 --> 01:39:19,534
Whatever evil was here
is no longer.

688
01:39:20,439 --> 01:39:21,871
But...

689
01:39:22,136 --> 01:39:23,866
The doll.

690
01:39:24,005 --> 01:39:26,850
It was a conduit
for the evil.

691
01:39:26,875 --> 01:39:29,275
That evil has moved on.

692
01:39:29,469 --> 01:39:31,854
Now the doll
is just a doll.

693
01:39:31,855 --> 01:39:33,368
So...

694
01:39:34,049 --> 01:39:36,229
... which one of you gets this?

695
01:40:01,525 --> 01:40:03,530
How are you holding up?

696
01:40:05,652 --> 01:40:07,509
I'm okay.

697
01:40:10,116 --> 01:40:13,977
You know, that wasn't Janice back there.
That was...

698
01:40:15,070 --> 01:40:17,008
... something else.

699
01:40:20,850 --> 01:40:22,483
I know.

700
01:40:59,713 --> 01:41:02,198
ST. JOACHIM
ORPHANAGE

701
01:41:02,223 --> 01:41:04,480
Hi there.
Welcome.

702
01:41:04,505 --> 01:41:06,735
Let's go right inside, shall we?

703
01:41:09,307 --> 01:41:12,136
She mostly keeps to herself,
that can be a bit quite,

704
01:41:12,161 --> 01:41:14,074
but she's a lovely girl.

705
01:41:14,099 --> 01:41:16,640
She's just been through a lot.

706
01:41:17,571 --> 01:41:19,831
I think you will love her.

707
01:41:22,301 --> 01:41:23,921
Hello.

708
01:41:24,118 --> 01:41:26,631
There's someone here to see you, sweetie.

709
01:41:29,141 --> 01:41:33,074
I want to introduce you to
Mr and Mrs Higgins.

710
01:41:34,467 --> 01:41:37,122
And you must be...

711
01:41:37,147 --> 01:41:39,570
- Annabelle.
- Annabelle.

712
01:41:39,595 --> 01:41:41,782
What a lovely name.

713
01:41:42,623 --> 01:41:44,699
We brought you a present.

714
01:41:48,031 --> 01:41:50,201
I hope you like dolls.

715
01:42:18,220 --> 01:42:26,356
12 YEARS LATER

716
01:42:37,189 --> 01:42:38,952
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.

717
01:42:38,953 --> 01:42:40,387
What is it?

718
01:42:40,388 --> 01:42:41,505
Stay here.

719
01:42:41,506 --> 01:42:42,973
No, no, no!
No, wait.

720
01:42:42,974 --> 01:42:44,158
It's okay.
It's alright, sweetheart.

721
01:42:44,159 --> 01:42:45,499
I'm just going to
take a quick look.

722
01:42:45,500 --> 01:42:47,403
Call the police.

723
01:43:01,089 --> 01:43:03,752
- Annabelle?
- Hi, Mom.

724
01:43:26,212 --> 01:43:27,795
John.

725
01:43:41,095 --> 01:43:47,257
