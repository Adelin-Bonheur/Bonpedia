1
00:00:22,166 --> 00:00:24,166
What I love about Nicole...

2
00:00:24,833 --> 00:00:28,253
she makes people feel comfortable
about even embarrassing things.

3
00:00:29,416 --> 00:00:31,096
Hey, you look like you care about animals.

4
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:31,955
Yes, I do.

5
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:34,291
She really listens
when someone is talking.

6
00:00:34,375 --> 00:00:36,415
- Do you want to sign up here?
- You know what? I...

7
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,670
It's funny, I actually signed up for this
but I never heard from you guys.

8
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,290
Sometimes she listens too much
for too long.

9
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:43,665
Okay, if you email me here...

10
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:46,000
- Thank you so much. Have a good day.
- Good luck.

11
00:00:46,083 --> 00:00:47,583
She's a good citizen.

12
00:00:48,541 --> 00:00:50,226
- Just call him.
- I'm not calling.

13
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,880
She always knows the right thing to do
when it comes to difficult family shit.

14
00:00:53,958 --> 00:00:54,958
Call him.

15
00:00:58,833 --> 00:01:00,213
I get stuck in my ways,

16
00:01:00,291 --> 00:01:03,331
and she knows when to push me
and when to leave me alone.

17
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:08,750
She cuts all our hair.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,580
Yeah!

19
00:01:20,666 --> 00:01:22,246
She's always inexplicably

20
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:24,833
brewing a cup of tea
that she doesn't drink.

21
00:01:29,666 --> 00:01:32,496
And it's not easy for her
to put away a sock, or close a cabinet,

22
00:01:32,583 --> 00:01:35,003
or do a dish, but she tries for me.

23
00:01:36,125 --> 00:01:40,825
Nicole grew up in LA around actors,
and directors, and movies, and TV,

24
00:01:40,916 --> 00:01:43,206
and is very close to her mother, Sandra,

25
00:01:43,291 --> 00:01:44,921
and Cassie, her sister.

26
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:48,495
- Hmm.
- Note the wrapping.

27
00:02:00,458 --> 00:02:02,958
Nicole gives great presents.

28
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,790
Uh...

29
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:09,713
She is a mother who plays,
really plays.

30
00:02:09,791 --> 00:02:11,001
- Lizard?
- Yeah.

31
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:13,785
She never steps off playing

32
00:02:13,875 --> 00:02:15,075
or says it's too much.

33
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:18,461
- Mom.
- And it must be too much some of the time.

34
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:22,131
"...chopped down a Christmas tree..."

35
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:23,708
All right.

36
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:25,955
Nice. Two, three, four... What?

37
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,290
Are you kidding me? I was just in jail!

38
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:30,665
Goddamn it!

39
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,580
- Do not laugh at me! Stop it!
- She's competitive.

40
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:38,076
She's amazing at opening jars
because of her strong arms,

41
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:40,166
which I've always found very sexy.

42
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,460
She keeps the fridge over-full.

43
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:44,381
No one is ever hungry in our house.

44
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,790
She can drive a stick.

45
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:51,125
How could you?

46
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:53,126
After that movie, All Over The Girl,

47
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,040
she could have stayed in LA
and been a movie star,

48
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:58,825
but she gave that up to do theater with me
in New York.

49
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:01,415
You might as well get what you paid for.

50
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:03,038
She's brave.

51
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:07,673
She's a great dancer.

52
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,250
Infectious. She makes me wish
I could dance.

53
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:14,328
She always says when she doesn't know
something, or hasn't read a book,

54
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:15,876
or seen a film or a play,

55
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:19,168
whereas I fake it or say something
like I haven't seen it in awhile.

56
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:26,131
My crazy ideas are her favorite things
to figure out how to execute.

57
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:33,083
Let's try it...

58
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:35,915
crawling...

59
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:40,293
but also standing.

60
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:42,955
She's my favorite actress.

61
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:46,921
What I love about Charlie...

62
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:48,958
Charlie is undaunted.

63
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:53,751
He never lets other people's opinions
or any setbacks

64
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,543
keep him from what he wants to do.

65
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:59,461
And he liked me, so...

66
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:02,421
Charlie eats like he's trying
to get it over with

67
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,000
and like there won't be enough food
for everyone.

68
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:07,753
A sandwich is to be strangled
while devoured.

69
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:09,786
Is your sweater on backwards?

70
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:14,038
But he's incredibly neat,
and I rely on him to keep things in order.

71
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:17,375
So...

72
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:19,946
He's energy-conscious.

73
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:21,833
Hey.

74
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:25,166
Sorry.

75
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,750
He doesn't look in the mirror
too often.

76
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:29,383
I cried four times.

77
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:30,381
Me too.

78
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:31,918
He cries easily in movies.

79
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,750
I wonder if it was the same four.

80
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:37,036
He's very self-sufficient.
He can darn a sock,

81
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:39,245
and cook himself dinner, and iron a shirt.

82
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:42,955
How are we doing over here?

83
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:44,211
The peppers are cut.

84
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:46,421
He rarely gets defeated, which...

85
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:48,383
I feel like I always do.

86
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:49,708
...I've got some carrots.

87
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,746
Charlie takes
all of my moods steadily.

88
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:56,213
He doesn't give in to them
or make me feel bad about them.

89
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:58,458
He's a great dresser.

90
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:02,040
He never looks embarrassing,
which is hard for a man.

91
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:04,628
Goddamn it, Charlie, get it together!

92
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:06,078
He's very competitive.

93
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:07,416
Oh, come on!

94
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:10,536
- What's this? Who owns Baltic Avenue?
- Me.

95
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:11,665
How much is it?

96
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,630
- I don't have enough.
- $450.

97
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:16,168
Okay, so I'm done?
I'm done, right? That's it?

98
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,790
This is so frustrating!

99
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:21,995
This is so frustrating. I always lose.

100
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:24,517
- Dad.
- He loves being a dad.

101
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:27,711
He loves all the things you're supposed
to hate, like the tantrums,

102
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:29,041
the waking up at night.

103
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:32,043
I had a bad dream.

104
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,083
It's okay.

105
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:41,075
It's almost annoying
how much he likes it,

106
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:43,166
but... then, it's mostly nice.

107
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,920
Dad, stay.

108
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:16,171
He disappears into his own world.

109
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:18,535
Shit.

110
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:20,345
- What's "shit?"
- This is our stop.

111
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:22,831
He and Henry
are alike in that way.

112
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:28,078
He can tell people when they have food
in their teeth or on their face

113
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:30,246
in a way that doesn't make them feel bad.

114
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Perfect.

115
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:34,133
Charlie is self-made.

116
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:35,706
His parents...

117
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:37,921
I only met them once, but...

118
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:42,375
he told me there was a lot of alcohol
and some violence in his childhood.

119
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:46,303
As soon as she comes with a lookout,
they're coming with a camcorder.

120
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:47,851
- Camcorder.
- Is that what they're called?

121
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:50,825
He moved to New York from Indiana
with no safety net,

122
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:53,166
and now he's more New Yorker
than any New Yorker.

123
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,130
I made sure they used
the right almond milk.

124
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:56,038
Genius.

125
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:59,495
He's brilliant at creating family
out of whoever is around.

126
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:05,575
With the theater company, he cast a spell
that made everyone feel included.

127
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:08,208
No one, not even an intern,
was unimportant.

128
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:10,631
He could remember all the inside jokes.

129
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:13,248
And where do you go when it's windy?

130
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:15,498
Oh, yeah, that... that was funny.

131
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,580
He's extremely organized
and thorough.

132
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:25,575
He's very clear about what he wants,

133
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:27,876
unlike me, who can't always tell.

134
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:29,785
Let's stop right there.

135
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:51,498
Who wants to start?

136
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:00,786
I-I'm not going to read this out loud.

137
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:04,458
Why is that?

138
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:06,668
Because I don't like what I wrote.

139
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:11,290
As we mediate your separation

140
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:13,785
and eventual divorce,

141
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:17,383
things can get quite contentious.

142
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:20,788
So, I like to begin
with a note of positivity,

143
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:25,415
for the people I work with to remember
why they got married in the first place.

144
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:28,461
And so that, as you come apart,

145
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:30,251
you're reminded that...

146
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:33,963
this is a person
you had great feeling for,

147
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:37,126
and maybe still do in many ways.

148
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:42,626
I'll read mine. I like what I wrote.

149
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:45,415
For it to really work,

150
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:47,286
you both have to read.

151
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:48,575
I'm not going to.

152
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,710
Okay, um...

153
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:55,035
I just think it's a shame
that you guys aren't going to get to hear,

154
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:57,581
uh, the wonderful things
you wrote about each other.

155
00:08:58,166 --> 00:09:00,826
She always says I can't write,
but I think mine's pretty good.

156
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:03,351
Nicole, maybe you'd change your mind
once you heard Charlie's.

157
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:04,785
I don't want to hear Charlie's.

158
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:06,125
We promised to listen.

159
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:07,208
That's right.

160
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:10,583
That's the very first step
in this process.

161
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:15,423
Well, I think I'm going to go
if you two are going to just sit around

162
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,540
and suck each other's dicks.

163
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:26,245
How can this evil allow moderation?

164
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:28,293
How can this evil
allow moderation?

165
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:31,171
How can it be right
to betray the departed?

166
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:34,455
How is it human to be so...

167
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:36,748
faithless?

168
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,670
I want no praise from impious men.

169
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:43,876
No home with them of quiet ease.

170
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:47,166
Noble blood still runs in my veins.

171
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:49,788
Shall I fail my father...

172
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:52,208
stifling my cries,

173
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:54,423
clipping the wings of grief?

174
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:59,126
Must his corpse in the ground
wretchedly waste away,

175
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:00,378
feebly count for nothing?

176
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:02,288
Must his killers gloat...

177
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:04,376
Must his killers gloat,

178
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:07,375
never to pay with blood, for blood...

179
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:10,328
Charlie gave me the note,
but it's really for you.

180
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:12,958
- He told me to pick up my cues.
- How is that for me?

181
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:14,751
Acting is reacting.

182
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:17,383
I'm responding to you.
You're slowing me down.

183
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:19,458
Frank, it's closing night, you know.

184
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:22,791
You don't think Charlie and Nicole
will ever get back together?

185
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:25,455
No, I think this time it's really over.

186
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:29,538
- It still feels weird.
- I feel like my parents are splitting up.

187
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:31,496
It's always been "Charlie and Nicole."

188
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:33,059
- Is Charlie still giving notes?
- Yep.

189
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:34,803
You're lucky, Nic.
I wish I was going to LA.

190
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:37,073
You can actually have space in LA.
There's no space here.

191
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:40,583
Ladies and gentlemen,

192
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:42,498
I want to make a toast

193
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,125
to Charlie...

194
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:47,461
and to our beloved Nicole,

195
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:51,881
who is going to be going out
on a new adventure,

196
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:54,916
all the way to sunny California.

197
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:58,668
And we are also going to try
something new.

198
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,750
We are going to take our play
to Broadway.

199
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:07,576
It reminds me of when I was a young person

200
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:09,956
and went to Broadway for the first time.

201
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:11,041
And I'm telling you,

202
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:14,918
winning your first Tony at 27,

203
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,130
it can mess with your head.

204
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:20,748
I mean, I was just a baby.
Elia Kazan was backstage...

205
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:22,513
I'm going to go over there now.

206
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:25,101
- Don't do it. Mary Ann?
- ...elbowing Mike Nichols.

207
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:27,745
And Mike was chatting with Dietrich,

208
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:31,923
and Marlene, you know,
she usually was a barrel of monkeys,

209
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,670
but tonight she was very, very serious.

210
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:37,876
Could you give me a second?

211
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:01,175
Well, I'd have to study it, but...

212
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:02,208
Hey.

213
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:05,583
Oh. Hey, I didn't expect you guys home
until late.

214
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:08,381
- How's he doing?
- Good, good. He went to bed on time.

215
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:09,288
No fuss.

216
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:11,415
Read him some of Cricket in Times Square.

217
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,460
God, you guys are so attractive.

218
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:18,626
Shit. Sorry, I didn't stop that
from being said.

219
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:20,825
No, it's okay.

220
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:23,576
I'll pay for the whole time.
We decided to come home early.

221
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:26,536
Hey, thanks.
And also the travel time.

222
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:43,386
...conversation
as well as anybody, but I've gotta run.

223
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:45,916
...if you know what I mean.

224
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,670
- Y-You're leaving?
- Well, I ain't moving in.

225
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,990
We'll be back when you get your...

226
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,630
If you don't like that mediator,
we'll find another one.

227
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:02,708
- Yeah.
- W-We might not need a mediator.

228
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:04,751
We'll just split everything anyway,
I don't care.

229
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:07,205
- Me neither.
- You can have most of it.

230
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:09,934
We'll get apartments near each other,
make it easier for Henry.

231
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:10,828
We'll figure it out.

232
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:12,706
- We want the same things.
- Right.

233
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,125
In the meantime,
the pilot will be fun for you.

234
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:19,628
You don't think it's bad, do you?

235
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:22,963
I don't ever watch TV,
so, you know, I can't tell.

236
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:31,333
Uh-huh.

237
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:34,833
I told Henry I'd come out to LA
in two weeks to see him.

238
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:39,333
Yes?

239
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:41,416
Nothing.

240
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:45,328
I can tell you want to give me a note.

241
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:46,416
No, I don't.

242
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:52,333
Yeah... I mean, yes, I do, but I guess...

243
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,975
I guess it doesn't matter now.
You won't be with the show anymore.

244
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
It's stupid.

245
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,710
You're not going to be able to sleep
until you tell me.

246
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:03,750
Maybe not.

247
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:05,916
Okay, then.

248
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:07,916
So, there are two things.

249
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:12,455
I thought your posture at the top
of scene seven is still too dignified.

250
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,420
- Okay.
- And then...

251
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:19,625
at the end, I could tell
you were pushing for the emotion.

252
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:21,673
Well, you know I can't cry on stage,

253
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:24,250
and I know you don't like it
when I fake it, but...

254
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:27,668
I thought maybe tonight
it would come, but...

255
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:29,958
it didn't.

256
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:31,883
That's all I had.

257
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:35,708
Thanks for indulging me.

258
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:41,956
Good night, Charlie.

00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:37,713

- What do you want to do today?

268
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:40,001
Hang out and relax with you.

269
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:41,878
- Me too.
- No relaxing.

270
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,575
Nicole has a hair and makeup test today,

271
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:47,996
and Henry, we got you into Fairy Camp
with the cousins.

272
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:50,041
I hate Fairy Camp.

273
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:52,325
Cassie says everyone likes Fairy Camp,

274
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:54,956
and I think this is true.

275
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:01,248
Henry, go make your mom some coffee
like I taught you.

276
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:03,793
- Hm?
- Mom, wait till you taste my coffee.

277
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:06,291
Mm.

278
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:07,495
Oop-a-doodle.

279
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:15,961
Do you always sleep together?
Even in New York?

280
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:19,211
No, it's just for right now
while we go through this transition.

281
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:20,791
Oh, shit.

282
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:24,001
Don't tell Charlie when he gets here.
He hates co-sleeping.

283
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,633
Well, I have to say, I agree with Charlie.

284
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:28,668
Oh, surprise surprise.

285
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:32,170
- It's as if you have exploded...
- Jesus, it's early.

286
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:34,038
...into this room.

287
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:36,375
I can do this part alone.

288
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:38,038
Fine. I won't look.

289
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:43,666
As long as you're in my house,
wake up is at 6:30 a.m.,

290
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:47,421
and until you know what you want to do,
we're going to do what I like to do.

291
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:51,170
I can't just go from what Charlie
wanted to do to what you want to do.

292
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:54,080
Even though I'm 64

293
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:55,956
and have a dead gay husband,

294
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:58,791
I manage to get up every day,

295
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:01,625
live my life,
and feel pretty good about myself.

296
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:03,788
So, maybe your mom knows a thing or two.

297
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,580
You know what I would do?

298
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:07,166
About what?

299
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:10,668
When Charlie gets here,
I'd whisk him off to Palm Springs.

300
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:13,880
That's what your father and I did
whenever we hit a speed bump.

301
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:17,290
Didn't you walk in on Dad
blowing the porter in Palm Springs?

302
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:21,075
And I always regretted
getting so upset about it.

303
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:25,166
Charlie and I are getting a divorce, Mom.
There's nothing for us in Palm Springs.

304
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,790
You need to wash your face
before you go to sleep.

305
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:29,208
When Daddy gets here,

306
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,750
- maybe we could all go on the Jaws ride.
- Yeah.

307
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:34,333
Or I could go once with Daddy
and once with you,

308
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:36,246
because I wouldn't mind
going twice anyway.

309
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:38,173
No, we'll all go together,
sweetheart.

310
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:41,538
Did you know that Universal Studios
is where I did my first screen test?

311
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:44,575
On the plane, I re-read the pilot
as if I were Charlie reading it,

312
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:46,626
and I started to think it was just bad.

313
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:49,245
My agent says it's one to watch.

314
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:50,541
Mmm.

315
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:53,205
- This coffee is good. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

316
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:55,501
What if Charlie is on Broadway

317
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:57,833
with a play I brought him,
which I originated,

318
00:17:57,916 --> 00:17:59,416
and I'm just doing bad TV?

319
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:03,540
Everyone is only impressed
when they see someone on TV.

320
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,184
- She's beautiful.
- Her wig looks great.

321
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:07,928
Where's she been
the past ten years?

322
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:10,538
Doing weird theater in New York,
downtown shit.

323
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:12,745
- I saw one. It rained onstage.
- Can I say something?

324
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:14,293
It was good. Edgy.

325
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:17,035
Directed by her husband,
supposedly very controlling.

326
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:19,851
- We're lucky to have her.
- I'm surprised she said yes.

327
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:22,434
- We can thank her divorce.
- Can she move her hand?

328
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:25,309
It's going to be hard to roto in the hair
on the baby around her fingers.

329
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:28,043
Can... you move your hand
further down the baby?

330
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:34,326
- Where? Like here?
- Off the head entirely.

331
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:36,481
I have to support his head.

332
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:39,961
No, no, support the head, of course.
Just try and do it from the... shoulders?

333
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,892
- It's perfect.
- Yes, good.

334
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:44,116
I can't hold a baby like this.

335
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:45,786
She's right, that's going to look weird.

336
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:50,476
It was very important to me
to have this show based on hard science.

337
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,220
So we can see your pretty face
and not ours.

338
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:55,630
You should've seen me
before the plants invaded.

339
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:56,918
I say that with respect.

340
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,460
I was raised by two mothers.

341
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,880
Can you lower the board please, Pablo?

342
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:05,078
Here? How about here?

343
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,330
- How about now?
- Why is there always a flirty grip?

344
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:10,767
I can do anything you want.
I just need her here two hours...

345
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:11,711
Can I say something?

346
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:13,671
Dennis, hold on. What, honey?

347
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:15,956
She has to know
how to hold a baby.

348
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:18,476
- Later on, after she kills Donny...
- She kills Donny?

349
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,580
That's a secret.
We didn't give the crew those pages.

350
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:23,101
...she becomes a sort of a Earth mother
to the plant community.

351
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:24,665
That's not going to make any sense

352
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,710
if we feel like she's a bad mother
to her own kid.

353
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,211
- She's right.
- Does Donny know?

354
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:30,767
- Must be nice to get out of New York.
- Well, I'm from out here.

355
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:33,251
Our daughter, Mia, is at NYU,
living in a shoebox.

356
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:35,423
She says it went up to 104 the other day.

357
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,880
- We are just so excited to have you.
- I'm excited to be here.

358
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:42,458
We're going for an early aughts aesthetic,
so having your presence just nails that.

359
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:43,711
What signifies early aughts?

360
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:45,461
Into The Girl was on TV...

361
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:47,559
- All Over The Girl.
- ...or streaming or something.

362
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,463
You are fucking hot in that movie.

363
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:51,291
- Carol.
- Fuck it, I speak my mind.

364
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:53,976
- We're not allowing our son to see it.
- Because you show your tits.

365
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,880
- Carol!
- Yeah.

366
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:56,578
- Dennis.
- This is Carter Mitchum.

367
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:59,076
He's a futurist at UCLA.

368
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:02,626
He's consulting on all the environmental
stuff for the show so it's accurate.

369
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:04,288
- Nice to meet you.
- Is it?

370
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:05,245
- What?
- Accurate?

371
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:06,333
So far, none of it.

372
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:09,536
This pilot will go.
So get ready to move back to LA.

373
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,415
Listen, everything you were saying
back there was absolutely right.

374
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,601
- If she's a bad mom, we lose the audience.
- Nobody knows we're killing Donny,

375
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:17,285
- including Donny.
- I... I thought...

376
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:20,245
Let us know if you'd like to be part
of our writer's room.

377
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:22,463
I bet you'd be really helpful, actually.

378
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:23,921
Or I could direct.

379
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:26,421
- No, yeah.
- Sorry, what? Maybe that sounds crazy.

380
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,670
No, do you have a reel?

381
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:32,248
No, because I've... I've never done it.
I watched my husband do it for years.

382
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:34,083
Almost ex-husband.

383
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:37,206
Oh, what's the opposite of fiancé?

384
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:39,091
Dennis and I will talk
to your agent about it.

385
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:42,455
At our theater I always wanted to direct,
and then Charlie would say something like,

386
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,381
"The next one,"
but he was always the director,

387
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:45,916
so there never was a next one.

388
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:49,961
I don't know. Maybe if we'd
stayed married, there would've been.

389
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:52,751
Yeah, no. We're going
to kill him off. It seems unlikely...

390
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:56,948
I'm going to give you a number.

391
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,750
Okay, is it a therapist?
Because I have a therapist.

392
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:02,671
Well, it's my mom's therapist.
We share her.

393
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:05,460
She's a lawyer. She represented me
when I left Dennis.

394
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:07,125
Oh.

395
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:08,670
You and Dennis are divorced?

396
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:09,880
Since 2013.

397
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:11,168
You still work together.

398
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:12,535
That's nice.

399
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:14,035
Oh, no, he's a fucking cocksucker.

400
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:16,625
Nora got me half of this project
in the settlement.

401
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:17,708
Oh.

402
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:20,205
Well, we talked about doing it
without lawyers.

403
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,380
My sister had me meet
a bunch of them already,

404
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:24,958
and I... just... hated them.

405
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,500
Call Nora.

406
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:28,581
She saved my life.

407
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:31,083
Sorry, I...

408
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:32,333
look so schleppy.

409
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:34,285
I had an event at my kid's school.

410
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:36,786
Let me get this out of the way.

411
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:39,205
I think you're a wonderful actress.

412
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:40,746
Thank you.

413
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,583
I loved All Over The Girl,

414
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:45,076
but the theater stuff too...

415
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:46,326
You saw the theater stuff?

416
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:48,626
I was in New York last year for my book,

417
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,710
which, remind me to give you a copy,

418
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:52,575
and my publisher took me.

419
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:53,666
Great.

420
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,040
- Thank you.
- You are awesome.

421
00:21:58,416 --> 00:22:00,706
- Well, Charlie directed it.
- I know.

422
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:02,291
He's very talented.

423
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:03,458
He is.

424
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,250
They're moving it to Broadway.

425
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:06,541
Hmm.

426
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,330
Well, without me, of course.

427
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:10,173
He was lucky to have you.

428
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:13,883
How are you doing?

429
00:22:21,875 --> 00:22:23,495
- Sorry.
- Oh.

430
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:25,881
Honey...

431
00:22:35,541 --> 00:22:36,881
You take some breaths.

432
00:22:38,041 --> 00:22:41,131
And while you do,
I'm going to tell you about myself.

433
00:22:41,958 --> 00:22:43,708
If you should choose to hire me,

434
00:22:43,791 --> 00:22:46,291
I will work tirelessly for you,

435
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:49,035
and I'm always available by phone or text,

436
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:50,575
except when I'm with my kids.

437
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:53,500
I insist on doing drop off and pick up
every day at school.

438
00:22:53,583 --> 00:22:55,743
- I understand.
- I've been through this myself.

439
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,671
Thank you Annie. So...

440
00:22:59,375 --> 00:23:00,915
I know how it feels.

441
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,830
- You do?
- Yes.

442
00:23:03,208 --> 00:23:06,578
I have a kid from my ex,
who is a narcissistic artist...

443
00:23:07,583 --> 00:23:08,923
and verbally abusive.

444
00:23:09,416 --> 00:23:11,956
I'm now with a great boyfriend
who lives in Malibu.

445
00:23:12,041 --> 00:23:13,381
Oh, good.

446
00:23:14,875 --> 00:23:16,245
Well, Charlie's not terrible.

447
00:23:16,333 --> 00:23:17,673
No, of course not.

448
00:23:18,083 --> 00:23:21,333
But they ravish you with attention
in the beginning...

449
00:23:21,416 --> 00:23:24,166
and then once we have babies,
we become the mom

450
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:26,210
and... they get sick of us.

451
00:23:26,291 --> 00:23:27,291
Yeah.

452
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:31,381
Where do you want to live now, doll?

453
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Well...

454
00:23:34,583 --> 00:23:36,923
I'm here now, obviously.

455
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,540
I don't know
if the show will get picked up, but...

456
00:23:40,916 --> 00:23:41,956
it feels like home.

457
00:23:43,333 --> 00:23:44,333
It is home.

458
00:23:45,125 --> 00:23:47,375
It's the only home I've ever known
without Charlie.

459
00:23:48,166 --> 00:23:49,326
You want to stay here?

460
00:23:50,291 --> 00:23:52,251
Charlie's not going to want that. He...

461
00:23:53,458 --> 00:23:54,288
He hates LA.

462
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:56,495
We're interested in what you want to do.

463
00:23:57,458 --> 00:24:00,378
Sounds to me
like you did your time in New York.

464
00:24:01,333 --> 00:24:03,083
He can do some time here, no?

465
00:24:03,541 --> 00:24:05,541
He always said we would, but he never...

466
00:24:06,375 --> 00:24:07,375
did.

467
00:24:07,833 --> 00:24:09,003
How old is your son?

468
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,330
Henry's eight.

469
00:24:10,416 --> 00:24:11,666
- Mmm.
- Yeah.

470
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:13,125
He likes LA.

471
00:24:15,958 --> 00:24:17,668
I don't know if it's fair to him.

472
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:20,748
I want you to listen to me.

473
00:24:22,791 --> 00:24:25,291
What you're doing is an act of hope.

474
00:24:26,375 --> 00:24:27,535
Do you understand that?

475
00:24:28,916 --> 00:24:29,916
Yeah.

476
00:24:30,458 --> 00:24:34,128
You're saying,
"I want something better for myself."

477
00:24:34,958 --> 00:24:35,958
I do.

478
00:24:36,375 --> 00:24:39,165
And this, right now, is the worst time.

479
00:24:40,166 --> 00:24:41,576
It will only get better.

480
00:24:43,833 --> 00:24:47,043
Wasn't it Tom Petty who said
"The waiting is the hardest part"?

481
00:24:47,125 --> 00:24:48,125
Oh.

482
00:24:48,416 --> 00:24:49,416
I don't know.

483
00:24:49,958 --> 00:24:52,578
I represented his wife in their divorce.

484
00:24:52,875 --> 00:24:54,285
I got her half of that song.

485
00:24:54,916 --> 00:24:57,076
Oh, I don't want any money or anything.

486
00:24:57,166 --> 00:24:58,076
Hmm.

487
00:24:58,166 --> 00:25:01,076
I just worry because we weren't
going to use lawyers, so...

488
00:25:01,916 --> 00:25:03,666
I don't want to be too aggressive.

489
00:25:05,041 --> 00:25:06,631
I want to stay friends.

490
00:25:08,208 --> 00:25:10,248
We'll do it as gently as possible.

491
00:25:11,583 --> 00:25:12,583
Now...

492
00:25:13,833 --> 00:25:15,293
Oh.

493
00:25:15,375 --> 00:25:18,075
Can you tell me a little more
about what's going on?

494
00:25:18,875 --> 00:25:22,415
Because part of what we're going to do
together is tell your story.

495
00:25:24,291 --> 00:25:26,291
It's difficult to articulate.

496
00:25:26,666 --> 00:25:27,666
It's...

497
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:30,170
not as simple
as not being in love anymore.

498
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:31,580
I understand.

499
00:25:32,916 --> 00:25:36,036
Why don't you start at the beginning?
Wherever that is for you.

500
00:25:38,458 --> 00:25:39,458
Well, uh...

501
00:25:40,875 --> 00:25:42,495
I was engaged to Ben

502
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:44,333
and living in LA, you know?

503
00:25:45,458 --> 00:25:49,378
And I felt like yes,
I want to make movies and marry Ben.

504
00:25:49,833 --> 00:25:52,293
Jesus,
I was only 19 or 20 at the time.

505
00:25:52,375 --> 00:25:54,455
I never felt older in my whole life.

506
00:25:54,541 --> 00:25:56,791
Anyway, if I was honest with myself,

507
00:25:56,875 --> 00:25:58,995
it was like a small part of me
felt dead...

508
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:00,250
or dead-ish.

509
00:26:00,916 --> 00:26:02,246
You know, you tell yourself,

510
00:26:02,333 --> 00:26:04,333
"No one's perfect,
no relationship's perfect."

511
00:26:06,833 --> 00:26:08,793
Oh, this tea is delicious.

512
00:26:08,875 --> 00:26:11,125
- Isn't it? It's the Manuka honey.
- Mm.

513
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,830
Anyway, uh, you were asking about Charlie.

514
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,750
So, um...

515
00:26:17,083 --> 00:26:19,133
So, yes. So, I was... I was...

516
00:26:19,666 --> 00:26:22,286
happy with Ben and aware of the deadness,

517
00:26:22,375 --> 00:26:23,955
and I went to New York

518
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:27,333
to meet with this director
for this space movie.

519
00:26:27,416 --> 00:26:30,126
But one where they take space seriously,
like...

520
00:26:30,208 --> 00:26:31,998
sex trafficking in space.

521
00:26:32,291 --> 00:26:33,631
You know, it was political.

522
00:26:33,708 --> 00:26:35,628
Or at least they wanted us
to think it was.

523
00:26:35,708 --> 00:26:36,958
Anyway, it just...

524
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:41,330
it was really fulfilling the same need
that certain fucked up porn does.

525
00:26:41,541 --> 00:26:43,211
Um, but anyway, so...

526
00:26:43,541 --> 00:26:44,711
while I was there...

527
00:26:45,625 --> 00:26:47,285
the producer...

528
00:26:47,375 --> 00:26:48,665
invited me to see a play.

529
00:26:50,458 --> 00:26:53,538
It took place in someone's apartment
with all the lights on.

530
00:26:54,083 --> 00:26:56,003
It was like nothing I'd ever seen before.

531
00:26:56,083 --> 00:26:58,133
This strange...

532
00:26:58,708 --> 00:27:01,168
surreal, dystopian story,

533
00:27:01,583 --> 00:27:03,043
and it was so well-acted.

534
00:27:03,416 --> 00:27:07,286
And one of the actors
was this big shaggy bear

535
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:10,205
who played all his lines
looking directly at me,

536
00:27:10,291 --> 00:27:13,581
uh, which I knew couldn't be the case,
but it felt like it.

537
00:27:14,083 --> 00:27:16,253
And then later, of course,
I learned that it was.

538
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:18,750
Mmm.

539
00:27:19,333 --> 00:27:22,133
- These cookies are really great too.
- I'll send you home with some.

540
00:27:22,208 --> 00:27:24,458
Afterwards,
I was introduced to the cast,

541
00:27:24,541 --> 00:27:28,131
and the bear turned out
to also be the director.

542
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:30,460
He talked to me and...

543
00:27:33,125 --> 00:27:34,165
I talked back.

544
00:27:36,458 --> 00:27:38,878
The dead part wasn't dead,
it was just in a coma.

545
00:27:39,375 --> 00:27:40,375
And...

546
00:27:41,333 --> 00:27:43,333
it was better than the sex, the talking.

547
00:27:43,791 --> 00:27:44,791
Although the...

548
00:27:45,458 --> 00:27:47,248
the sex was also like the talking.

549
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:49,673
You know, everything is like everything
in a relationship.

550
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:50,750
Don't you find that?

551
00:27:51,666 --> 00:27:52,666
And, um...

552
00:27:53,125 --> 00:27:54,125
So, we spent...

553
00:27:55,416 --> 00:27:57,786
the whole night
and the next day together and...

554
00:27:59,416 --> 00:28:00,456
I just never left.

555
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,790
Yes, to be honest, all the problems
were there in the beginning too.

556
00:28:05,166 --> 00:28:07,166
But... I just went along with him
and his life

557
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:10,080
because it felt so damn good
to feel myself alive.

558
00:28:11,791 --> 00:28:14,711
In the beginning,
I was the actress, the star, and...

559
00:28:15,541 --> 00:28:19,211
That felt like something, you know.
People came to see me at first, but...

560
00:28:20,208 --> 00:28:22,328
the farther away I got from that and...

561
00:28:23,208 --> 00:28:26,168
the more acclaim the theater company got,
and I had less and less weight.

562
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:27,580
I just became...

563
00:28:28,333 --> 00:28:29,173
"Who?"

564
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:32,500
"Well, you know, the actress
that was in that thing that time."

565
00:28:32,583 --> 00:28:33,633
And he was the draw.

566
00:28:34,208 --> 00:28:36,168
And... that...

567
00:28:37,416 --> 00:28:38,746
would've been fine, but...

568
00:28:40,625 --> 00:28:41,825
I got smaller.

569
00:28:48,666 --> 00:28:49,746
I realized I...

570
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,210
I didn't ever really
come alive for myself.

571
00:28:53,291 --> 00:28:55,041
I was just feeding his aliveness.

572
00:28:56,291 --> 00:28:57,291
And...

573
00:28:58,458 --> 00:28:59,578
you know...

574
00:28:59,791 --> 00:29:01,961
he was so smart and creative, it...

575
00:29:02,625 --> 00:29:03,625
it was fine.

576
00:29:04,416 --> 00:29:07,576
You know, I would tell him things
at home in private,

577
00:29:07,666 --> 00:29:11,246
and they would work their way into public
conversation into his work, and...

578
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:14,751
For a while, that felt like enough.
I mean, I was just so...

579
00:29:14,916 --> 00:29:15,916
so...

580
00:29:16,166 --> 00:29:18,246
so flattered
that someone like him would...

581
00:29:18,333 --> 00:29:20,503
would find an idea I had worth trying

582
00:29:20,583 --> 00:29:23,043
or a comment I made worth repeating and...

583
00:29:23,666 --> 00:29:25,376
and then, I got pregnant.

584
00:29:25,458 --> 00:29:28,958
And I thought that having a baby
could be ours, could really be ours,

585
00:29:29,041 --> 00:29:30,461
but also really mine.

586
00:29:30,875 --> 00:29:33,915
And... you know, he was so excited.

587
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,460
So, it was nice.

588
00:29:36,041 --> 00:29:37,041
For a while.

589
00:29:37,708 --> 00:29:39,038
I mean, kids, they...

590
00:29:39,708 --> 00:29:41,668
they belong to themselves. It's like...

591
00:29:41,833 --> 00:29:44,423
the instant they leave your body,
it's just...

592
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:47,580
the process of them going away...

593
00:29:48,625 --> 00:29:50,245
And I didn't belong to myself.

594
00:29:50,541 --> 00:29:53,751
And it was small stuff, stupid stuff,
and big stuff.

595
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,210
All the furniture in our house

596
00:29:56,583 --> 00:29:57,583
was his taste.

597
00:29:57,666 --> 00:29:59,746
I didn't even know
what my taste was anymore

598
00:29:59,833 --> 00:30:02,083
because I had never been asked to use it.

599
00:30:02,583 --> 00:30:05,333
I didn't even pick our apartment.
I just moved into his.

600
00:30:05,416 --> 00:30:08,326
And I made noises
about wanting to move back to LA, but...

601
00:30:08,416 --> 00:30:09,666
they came to nothing.

602
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:12,290
And we'd come here on holidays
because he liked my family.

603
00:30:12,375 --> 00:30:14,995
But if I suggested
we do a year or something,

604
00:30:15,833 --> 00:30:16,963
he'd just put me off.

605
00:30:17,291 --> 00:30:18,541
It would be...

606
00:30:19,458 --> 00:30:22,248
strange if he turned to me and said,

607
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,670
"And what do you want to do today?"

608
00:30:25,666 --> 00:30:28,996
You know, I just watched that documentary
on George Harrison,

609
00:30:29,333 --> 00:30:30,793
and I thought, "Own it.

610
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:32,460
Just own it.

611
00:30:32,666 --> 00:30:34,166
Be like George Harrison's wife.

612
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:36,380
Being a wife and a mother, that's enough."

613
00:30:36,791 --> 00:30:39,831
Yeah, then I realized
I couldn't remember her name, so...

614
00:30:41,666 --> 00:30:43,626
This pilot came along.

615
00:30:44,208 --> 00:30:47,498
It shot in LA
and it paid so much...

616
00:30:47,583 --> 00:30:50,543
And it was like there was
this little lifeline thrown to me.

617
00:30:50,791 --> 00:30:53,791
Here's this bit of earth that's yours,
and...

618
00:30:54,958 --> 00:30:58,288
I was embarrassed about it
in front of him, but it was also like...

619
00:30:59,083 --> 00:31:03,043
yeah, this is who I am,
and this is what I'm worth.

620
00:31:03,125 --> 00:31:06,205
And maybe it's stupid,
but at least it's mine.

621
00:31:07,291 --> 00:31:11,291
And if he had just taken me
into a big hug and said,

622
00:31:11,625 --> 00:31:13,995
"Baby, I'm so excited for your adventure.

623
00:31:14,083 --> 00:31:17,043
Of course I want you to have
a piece of earth that's yours."

624
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,500
Then...

625
00:31:18,666 --> 00:31:20,876
Well, then,
we might not be getting divorced.

626
00:31:21,125 --> 00:31:22,125
But...

627
00:31:22,916 --> 00:31:24,916
he made fun of it and...

628
00:31:25,416 --> 00:31:27,666
was jealous like he is, and...

629
00:31:28,625 --> 00:31:30,705
then he realized about the money.

630
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:34,380
And he told me I could funnel it
back into the theater company.

631
00:31:35,875 --> 00:31:38,125
And that's when I realized...

632
00:31:39,291 --> 00:31:40,291
he...

633
00:31:41,583 --> 00:31:42,793
truly didn't see me.

634
00:31:44,125 --> 00:31:46,705
He didn't see me as something
separate from himself.

635
00:31:47,791 --> 00:31:50,001
And I asked him to say my phone number.

636
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:52,290
He didn't know it.

637
00:31:52,833 --> 00:31:53,833
So, I left.

638
00:31:55,375 --> 00:31:56,455
Oh.

639
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:59,328
Mmm.

640
00:32:00,458 --> 00:32:03,578
Also, I think he slept
with the stage manager, Mary Ann.

641
00:32:05,375 --> 00:32:07,035
That fucking asshole.

642
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:08,285
Seventy-five...

643
00:32:08,541 --> 00:32:09,751
just 70,

644
00:32:09,833 --> 00:32:11,333
those two zeros,

645
00:32:11,416 --> 00:32:13,767
- seventy-five point zero zero...
- "If railroad is unowned...

646
00:32:13,791 --> 00:32:16,081
- that's zero cents.
- ...you may buy it from the bank."

647
00:32:16,166 --> 00:32:18,876
"Advance to Illios...

648
00:32:18,958 --> 00:32:21,208
- Illinois.
- ...Illinois Avenue."

649
00:32:21,833 --> 00:32:23,583
"Advance..." what does that mean?

650
00:32:23,958 --> 00:32:25,788
It means you've got to go
to Illinois Avenue.

651
00:32:25,875 --> 00:32:28,205
So where is Illinois Avenue?

652
00:32:28,291 --> 00:32:29,291
That one.

653
00:32:29,708 --> 00:32:31,388
So Cassie,
when Charlie gets here,

654
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:32,936
you're going to hand him the envelope.

655
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,630
Why do I have to do it?

656
00:32:34,708 --> 00:32:38,748
Because Nicole is very good
at getting people to do things for her.

657
00:32:38,833 --> 00:32:40,293
That's not what this is.

658
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:42,495
I wiped her butt
until she was nine years old.

659
00:32:42,583 --> 00:32:43,793
She's very seductive that way.

660
00:32:43,875 --> 00:32:46,665
No, Mom, legally,
I can't be the one who serves him.

661
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:48,960
But still, what I'm saying is true.

662
00:32:49,041 --> 00:32:51,921
Do I have to actually hand him
the envelope?

663
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,726
Yes, but I'm going to tell him in advance
that they're divorce papers.

664
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:57,880
Nora says it doesn't have to be so formal.
Where's Henry?

665
00:32:58,166 --> 00:33:01,036
He's playing in the living room
with Sam, and Jules, and Molly.

666
00:33:01,125 --> 00:33:03,351
Let's get them upstairs.
Charlie's going to be here soon.

667
00:33:03,375 --> 00:33:04,415
Sam, go upstairs.

668
00:33:04,458 --> 00:33:06,708
So, I'll tell Charlie
what's happening,

669
00:33:06,791 --> 00:33:09,711
and, Cassie,
you then hand him the envelope.

670
00:33:09,791 --> 00:33:10,791
Okay...

671
00:33:11,208 --> 00:33:12,078
I just get nervous.

672
00:33:12,166 --> 00:33:14,376
Well, can you un-serve?

673
00:33:15,125 --> 00:33:17,535
- What do you mean? Like take it back?
- Yeah.

674
00:33:18,583 --> 00:33:19,923
- I think so.
- You should check.

675
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,710
- In case we change our minds...
- I'm not going to change my mind.

676
00:33:22,791 --> 00:33:25,517
- ...or we feel too bad for him.
- Maybe in case I do something wrong.

677
00:33:25,541 --> 00:33:27,461
Now you're both
just making me feel bad, okay?

678
00:33:27,541 --> 00:33:28,921
Sorry, sorry, I'm nervous!

679
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,790
Well, we all are.

680
00:33:30,916 --> 00:33:32,666
And we love Charlie.

681
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:34,630
You have to stop loving him, Mom.

682
00:33:34,708 --> 00:33:36,538
You can't be friends with him anymore.

683
00:33:36,625 --> 00:33:39,035
Charlie and I have our own relationship...

684
00:33:39,125 --> 00:33:41,285
...independent of your marriage.

685
00:33:41,583 --> 00:33:43,083
Just like I'm still friends

686
00:33:43,166 --> 00:33:45,036
with Cassie's ex, Jeff.

687
00:33:45,125 --> 00:33:46,495
Are you still seeing Jeff?

688
00:33:46,875 --> 00:33:48,705
An occasional lunch.

689
00:33:48,791 --> 00:33:50,041
I can't believe you!

690
00:33:50,125 --> 00:33:51,955
He still wants his camera back,
by the way.

691
00:33:52,041 --> 00:33:55,171
Listen, nothing can be independent
of our marriage right now.

692
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:58,290
I can't believe I even have to explain
this to you. Just be on my side, okay?

693
00:33:58,375 --> 00:33:59,745
- Okay.
- And...

694
00:34:00,333 --> 00:34:01,543
stop seeing Jeff!

695
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:05,921
Cassie, you're the server.

696
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,330
Just let me practice a few times.

697
00:34:08,708 --> 00:34:10,378
I was never a good auditioner.

698
00:34:10,458 --> 00:34:13,208
- That's because you wanted it too badly.
- It's not an audition.

699
00:34:13,291 --> 00:34:17,081
- I'll play Charlie.
- It's just my palms are so perspired.

700
00:34:17,208 --> 00:34:19,538
Sweetie, you're blotting the envelope.

701
00:34:19,625 --> 00:34:21,575
Maybe Nicole should play you.

702
00:34:21,666 --> 00:34:22,826
Did you really just say that?

703
00:34:22,916 --> 00:34:25,076
We don't need to practice.
This is not a performance.

704
00:34:25,166 --> 00:34:26,646
Did we finish the other wine already?

705
00:34:26,708 --> 00:34:27,809
Yeah.

706
00:34:27,833 --> 00:34:28,883
Oh!

707
00:34:28,958 --> 00:34:30,788
- Oh.
- Okay, let me get him.

708
00:34:30,875 --> 00:34:32,392
- Okay.
- You both go in the other room.

709
00:34:32,416 --> 00:34:35,166
Cassie, you make sure that Henry
goes upstairs with Molly and Jules.

710
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:36,250
Happening now.

711
00:34:38,166 --> 00:34:40,126
- Mom!
- I'm getting my wine.

712
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:41,830
What?

713
00:34:41,916 --> 00:34:43,666
Henry's pooping
in the bathroom downstairs.

714
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:45,350
Can we transfer him to the one upstairs?

715
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:47,745
- I think it's mid-poop.
- Just grab him when he comes out.

716
00:34:47,833 --> 00:34:49,043
- Cassie?
- What?

717
00:34:49,125 --> 00:34:52,455
I'm... I'm putting the envelope
over here by the toaster.

718
00:34:52,541 --> 00:34:53,671
Copy you.

719
00:34:59,958 --> 00:35:00,878
- Hi.
- Hi.

720
00:35:00,958 --> 00:35:03,128
- Where's Henry?
- Uh, he's pooping.

721
00:35:03,833 --> 00:35:04,833
Hi, Henry!

722
00:35:06,041 --> 00:35:07,421
Does this couch still open?

723
00:35:07,625 --> 00:35:08,625
Yeah.

724
00:35:08,833 --> 00:35:12,713
I got off the plane to a text, but don't
tell anyone yet. It's still a secret.

725
00:35:12,791 --> 00:35:13,881
Okay.

726
00:35:16,708 --> 00:35:18,628
I won a MacArthur grant.

727
00:35:19,041 --> 00:35:20,041
Charlie!

728
00:35:20,083 --> 00:35:21,673
Oh, my God, that's great!

729
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:22,920
Congratulations.

730
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,170
I'll say it because you can't,
it's the genius grant. You're a genius.

731
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:28,250
Oh, I'm really happy for you.
You deserve it.

732
00:35:28,333 --> 00:35:30,833
It's yours too.
We did all of this together.

733
00:35:30,916 --> 00:35:31,916
Thank you, but...

734
00:35:32,541 --> 00:35:34,291
it's yours, Charlie, you enjoy it.

735
00:35:35,041 --> 00:35:36,171
I'm starving.

736
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:38,410
It's good money,
and they parse it out over five years.

737
00:35:38,458 --> 00:35:41,018
But it means I can keep everyone
in the theater company employed,

738
00:35:41,083 --> 00:35:42,083
pay my credit card debt.

739
00:35:42,125 --> 00:35:43,285
So great.

740
00:35:43,375 --> 00:35:46,125
Of course, I went instantly to,
"It's all downhill from here.

741
00:35:46,208 --> 00:35:48,708
- Now my first Broadway play has to fail."
- No.

742
00:35:48,791 --> 00:35:50,791
We just started rehearsals again,
and I don't know.

743
00:35:50,833 --> 00:35:53,226
You always don't know at this point,
and then, it gets there.

744
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:54,750
Do I? Because I don't remember.

745
00:35:54,833 --> 00:35:56,923
I know, it's true, it'll be great.

746
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,500
Okay, I hope you're right.

747
00:35:59,041 --> 00:36:00,671
- Everyone says hi.
- Oh.

748
00:36:02,833 --> 00:36:04,503
Tell them hi. I miss everyone.

749
00:36:04,583 --> 00:36:06,583
You'll see them again
when you come back.

750
00:36:06,625 --> 00:36:08,785
A MacArthur, Broadway...

751
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:10,285
It's so exciting.

752
00:36:10,833 --> 00:36:12,503
Congratulations, Charlie.

753
00:36:19,291 --> 00:36:20,331
Which bathroom?

754
00:36:22,041 --> 00:36:23,541
- What?
- Is he pooping?

755
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,000
Oh, uh, downstairs.

756
00:36:26,166 --> 00:36:27,166
Is your mom home?

757
00:36:27,833 --> 00:36:28,923
Yeah, she's upstairs.

758
00:36:32,166 --> 00:36:33,926
- Hey, how's it going?
- Nothing yet.

759
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:35,248
- It's me.
- I know.

760
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:37,290
- I just got here.
- Hi.

761
00:36:37,375 --> 00:36:38,975
- I brought you something.
- Yay.

762
00:36:39,041 --> 00:36:40,711
Mom's getting me a present too.

763
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,880
- Why?
- For pooping.

764
00:36:44,083 --> 00:36:45,083
Oh.

765
00:36:46,875 --> 00:36:48,535
- I love you.
- I love you.

766
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:51,580
I don't think we should reward him
for pooping anymore.

767
00:36:51,666 --> 00:36:53,996
Oh, I know, but he holds it in
and it's going on a week.

768
00:36:54,083 --> 00:36:56,753
- It's its own reward. G-ma!
- Charlie-bird!

769
00:36:56,833 --> 00:36:58,713
Oh! No! Stop it!

770
00:36:58,791 --> 00:37:00,421
Oh, God, I'm huge!

771
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,580
- You're as light as a feather.
- Mom?

772
00:37:03,583 --> 00:37:07,003
- Why didn't you respond to my last email?
- Well, your emails are so articulate.

773
00:37:07,083 --> 00:37:08,683
I get intimidated.

774
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:11,000
- Mom, can you...
- Now, I'm going to lift you!

775
00:37:11,083 --> 00:37:13,673
Mom?

776
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:14,750
Mom?

777
00:37:15,833 --> 00:37:17,083
- Mom?
- What?

778
00:37:17,166 --> 00:37:18,246
Upstairs.

779
00:37:18,333 --> 00:37:19,793
Oh.

780
00:37:19,875 --> 00:37:21,575
I'm going to write you back now.

781
00:37:25,541 --> 00:37:26,711
Cassie?

782
00:37:27,458 --> 00:37:28,458
Hey, Charlie.

783
00:37:28,541 --> 00:37:29,791
I like your haircut.

784
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:31,250
Oh, thanks.

785
00:37:33,083 --> 00:37:34,423
- Mom?
- I'll go.

786
00:37:34,958 --> 00:37:36,828
Henry's calling you, Nicole!

787
00:37:36,916 --> 00:37:37,916
I hear him.

788
00:37:38,875 --> 00:37:40,325
What's going on, Henry?

789
00:37:40,416 --> 00:37:42,036
Can you ask Mom to come?

790
00:37:44,041 --> 00:37:45,041
He wants you.

791
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:49,500
What kind of pie is that?

792
00:37:52,125 --> 00:37:53,125
It's...

793
00:37:57,708 --> 00:37:58,708
pecan.

794
00:38:00,041 --> 00:38:01,751
- Did you make it?
- I don't know.

795
00:38:02,416 --> 00:38:03,536
No, it's store bought.

796
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:05,500
You know Joan's on Third?

797
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:07,633
- Oh, yeah. It's good, right?
- What?

798
00:38:07,916 --> 00:38:09,076
The store? Yeah.

799
00:38:10,166 --> 00:38:11,416
Jules and Molly love it.

800
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:12,920
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

801
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:15,083
I'm just hot!

802
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,880
Uh, I'll pour you some water.

803
00:38:19,375 --> 00:38:20,995
Nicole says you're doing a play?

804
00:38:21,125 --> 00:38:22,625
I-I think you'd like it.

805
00:38:22,708 --> 00:38:26,288
It's a great unproduced play
by this really interesting British writer.

806
00:38:26,875 --> 00:38:28,726
- So, you do an English accent?
- Yeah.

807
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:30,790
- It's more northern England.
- Oh.

808
00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:31,995
What does that sound like?

809
00:38:33,916 --> 00:38:36,876
Ooh, you want a cup of tea, do ya?

810
00:38:38,416 --> 00:38:40,036
Right. Good.

811
00:38:41,375 --> 00:38:44,745
Oh, thank you, missus. What is...

812
00:38:45,708 --> 00:38:46,788
What's this?

813
00:38:46,833 --> 00:38:49,003
Oh, it's a manila envelope, love.

814
00:38:49,083 --> 00:38:51,476
- Ooh, can I start over?
- It has my name on it.

815
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:52,500
Ooh.

816
00:38:56,333 --> 00:38:57,333
Oh.

817
00:38:57,708 --> 00:38:58,788
Jesus.

818
00:38:58,916 --> 00:39:01,246
Sorry. You're served.

819
00:39:03,375 --> 00:39:05,125
- What did you do?
- Nothing. I don't know.

820
00:39:05,625 --> 00:39:07,245
I can't lie.

821
00:39:07,333 --> 00:39:08,793
You're being served.

822
00:39:08,875 --> 00:39:11,625
You guys are getting a div...
I don't know, I'm sorry.

823
00:39:17,958 --> 00:39:20,708
I was going to warn you
so it didn't become a thing. I'm sorry.

824
00:39:34,208 --> 00:39:35,578
I feel like I'm in a dream.

825
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:39,003
We don't have a marriage anymore.

826
00:39:39,083 --> 00:39:42,713
I-I know you don't want the disruption,
but you don't want to be married.

827
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,630
Not... really.

828
00:39:46,833 --> 00:39:48,043
But I don't want this.

829
00:39:50,875 --> 00:39:53,205
What did you expect was going to happen?

830
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:59,250
I... I don't know,
I guess I didn't think it through,

831
00:39:59,333 --> 00:40:02,883
but I thought we agreed
we weren't going to use lawyers.

832
00:40:03,333 --> 00:40:04,673
I want...

833
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:08,790
I don't know, I'm trying to say this
as undramatically as possible.

834
00:40:08,875 --> 00:40:10,035
I want...

835
00:40:11,666 --> 00:40:13,706
an entirely different kind of life.

836
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:17,130
Let's wait until you finish this pilot
and come back to New York.

837
00:40:17,208 --> 00:40:19,208
Let's figure it out there,
at home, together.

838
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:22,226
- Nora's known for being very fair.
- We don't need to do it with envelopes.

839
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:23,080
- This is Nora?
- Yeah.

840
00:40:23,166 --> 00:40:25,286
She's great. I feel like
we could be friends with her.

841
00:40:25,333 --> 00:40:28,583
- Why do I feel like that won't happen?
- It's just a formality.

842
00:40:28,666 --> 00:40:30,476
- Why...
- You don't have to respond right away.

843
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,000
Why did Cassie have a pie?

844
00:40:32,333 --> 00:40:34,883
The pie was hers.
The pie wasn't part of it.

845
00:40:34,958 --> 00:40:35,788
Are you sure?

846
00:40:35,875 --> 00:40:38,075
I mean, what would the pie
have to do with anything?

847
00:40:38,166 --> 00:40:40,576
I don't know. It somehow makes it worse.

848
00:40:41,458 --> 00:40:43,788
I'm sorry, but the pie was just a pie.

849
00:40:44,833 --> 00:40:45,883
So, what...

850
00:40:48,916 --> 00:40:49,996
What do I do?

851
00:40:52,708 --> 00:40:53,878
You get a lawyer too.

852
00:40:57,791 --> 00:40:59,921
"Well, I guess
I better be going.

853
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,250
Stuart rose from the ditch,
climbed into his car...

854
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,460
and started up the road
that led toward the north.

855
00:41:07,375 --> 00:41:10,125
The sun was just coming up
over the hills on his right.

856
00:41:11,083 --> 00:41:14,583
As he peered ahead into the great land
that stretched before him,

857
00:41:15,125 --> 00:41:16,455
the way seemed long...

858
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,790
but the sky was bright.

859
00:41:19,625 --> 00:41:22,495
And he somehow felt
he was headed in the right direction."

860
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:27,130
I forgot it ended that way.

861
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:31,670
Yeah, wow, Stuart really overreacted,
didn't you think?

862
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:34,166
He was upset about his boat.

863
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:40,040
Dad, you go away.

864
00:41:41,083 --> 00:41:43,043
Mom, you stay.

865
00:41:43,416 --> 00:41:46,376
- Hey, Daddy just got here.
- It's okay.

866
00:41:47,791 --> 00:41:48,791
Love you.

867
00:41:52,375 --> 00:41:56,785
You can come back, and wake me up,
and read to me later, Daddy, okay?

868
00:41:57,291 --> 00:41:58,291
Okay.

869
00:42:00,666 --> 00:42:02,876
Will you come sleep
in my bed later?

870
00:42:02,958 --> 00:42:03,958
Yeah.

871
00:42:13,125 --> 00:42:14,125
Oh.

872
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:16,460
Hang in there, Charlie-bird.

873
00:42:16,625 --> 00:42:17,625
Thanks, G-ma.

874
00:42:47,291 --> 00:42:49,581
- He's in a mommy phase right now.
- It's okay.

875
00:42:58,916 --> 00:42:59,746
Whoo!

876
00:42:59,833 --> 00:43:01,923
I'm sorry. I drank too much wine.

877
00:43:02,333 --> 00:43:04,043
- I can imagine.
- And didn't eat dinner.

878
00:43:04,125 --> 00:43:05,455
Stressful time.

879
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:07,750
I hope Henry didn't notice.

880
00:43:07,833 --> 00:43:08,833
I'm sure he didn't.

881
00:43:08,875 --> 00:43:10,555
Now that I'm a parent,
I realize my parents

882
00:43:10,583 --> 00:43:12,223
were probably drunk all the time with me.

883
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:13,250
Yeah.

884
00:43:13,291 --> 00:43:14,461
I'm sorry again.

885
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:17,250
Thanks.

886
00:43:18,333 --> 00:43:19,463
Where are you staying?

887
00:43:23,041 --> 00:43:24,831
Oh, well, I...

888
00:43:26,375 --> 00:43:27,415
hadn't...

889
00:43:31,583 --> 00:43:32,583
I guess I'll...

890
00:43:34,958 --> 00:43:37,248
There's a new hotel on Highland that's...

891
00:43:38,083 --> 00:43:41,543
supposedly not too expensive
and... and pretty nice.

892
00:43:41,958 --> 00:43:43,668
Oh, okay, I'll check it out.

893
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:46,540
Again, that's great
about the MacArthur.

894
00:43:46,916 --> 00:43:47,916
Thanks.

895
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,000
- Charlie?
- Yeah?

896
00:44:00,708 --> 00:44:01,578
Thanks.

897
00:44:08,916 --> 00:44:09,746
Fuck.

898
00:44:09,833 --> 00:44:13,083
- What?
- She's being represented by Nora.

899
00:44:13,166 --> 00:44:14,576
She's supposedly very fair?

900
00:44:14,666 --> 00:44:16,456
All right, here's the fact, Jack.

901
00:44:17,083 --> 00:44:20,083
I charge $950 an hour.

902
00:44:20,166 --> 00:44:21,626
Ted is 400.

903
00:44:22,083 --> 00:44:24,753
If you have a stupid question,
you call Ted.

904
00:44:26,333 --> 00:44:29,083
To start, we'll need a $25,000 retainer.

905
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:31,184
- That's more than I can...
- And all your financials.

906
00:44:31,208 --> 00:44:32,748
We need to do a forensic accounting.

907
00:44:32,833 --> 00:44:36,333
Which runs anywhere
from ten to twenty thousand dollars.

908
00:44:37,041 --> 00:44:39,671
But if we can all agree right away,
it shouldn't get too bad,

909
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:42,080
- right?
- You were married here in LA?

910
00:44:42,166 --> 00:44:44,456
Yes... because her mom and sister
are out here

911
00:44:44,541 --> 00:44:47,211
- and I'm not close with my family.
- Your son was born out here?

912
00:44:47,291 --> 00:44:50,791
Yes, because, again, her mom
and sister are out here and I'm not...

913
00:44:50,875 --> 00:44:52,415
So, you got married here,

914
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:54,250
your kid was born here...

915
00:44:55,833 --> 00:44:57,133
and she served you here?

916
00:44:57,208 --> 00:44:58,998
Yeah, but we lived in New York.

917
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Why?

918
00:45:02,333 --> 00:45:04,833
- Is there a problem?
- We'll have to reshape the narrative.

919
00:45:04,916 --> 00:45:08,746
If you're serious
about having your child in New York,

920
00:45:08,833 --> 00:45:10,463
this is what I suggest.

921
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:13,421
You take your kid...
D-Did you say his name was Fred?

922
00:45:14,166 --> 00:45:14,996
Henry.

923
00:45:15,083 --> 00:45:16,003
Henry?

924
00:45:16,083 --> 00:45:17,293
Why did I say Fred?

925
00:45:17,375 --> 00:45:18,875
I have a kid named Fred.

926
00:45:18,958 --> 00:45:22,498
You take Henry to New York
with you right now.

927
00:45:22,583 --> 00:45:24,883
Then we file an action in New York.

928
00:45:25,166 --> 00:45:26,326
We make this a New York case.

929
00:45:26,375 --> 00:45:28,892
We need to make an argument
that you're a New York-based family.

930
00:45:28,916 --> 00:45:29,746
Well, we are.

931
00:45:29,833 --> 00:45:32,753
Otherwise, you'll probably never
see your kid outside of LA again.

932
00:45:32,833 --> 00:45:34,503
Really? No.

933
00:45:34,583 --> 00:45:37,793
It's very hard
to convince the courts to move a kid.

934
00:45:37,875 --> 00:45:41,075
As soon as you let your wife and child
leave New York,

935
00:45:41,166 --> 00:45:43,996
you made life very difficult for yourself.

936
00:45:44,083 --> 00:45:45,333
Yes, but as I said,

937
00:45:45,416 --> 00:45:47,876
we're a New York family,
that's just a fact.

938
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:50,750
She's... here temporarily.

939
00:45:51,208 --> 00:45:53,628
Then why do you think
she served you out here?

940
00:45:54,291 --> 00:45:58,421
I don't... know,
but Henry wants to go back to New York.

941
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:00,460
Don't quote your kid.

942
00:46:01,250 --> 00:46:03,420
He's just telling you
what you want to hear.

943
00:46:04,208 --> 00:46:07,168
And trust me,
he's telling her the opposite.

944
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:08,750
Let me have the Barber file!

945
00:46:08,833 --> 00:46:10,043
It's right here.

946
00:46:10,416 --> 00:46:12,036
Move my lunch to 1:30.

947
00:46:16,625 --> 00:46:17,625
What's...

948
00:46:19,625 --> 00:46:21,165
"Exit Goat"?

949
00:46:21,583 --> 00:46:24,213
Exit Ghost. It's the name
of my theater company.

950
00:46:24,291 --> 00:46:25,291
You're a director?

951
00:46:25,541 --> 00:46:27,081
Theater director, yeah.

952
00:46:27,166 --> 00:46:29,876
- Anything I've seen?
- I don't know. What have you seen?

953
00:46:32,458 --> 00:46:34,538
Our production of Electra
is moving to Broadway...

954
00:46:35,791 --> 00:46:36,631
which is exciting.

955
00:46:36,708 --> 00:46:38,918
We have to make sure
that money is protected.

956
00:46:39,083 --> 00:46:41,633
I mean, it's theater,
so it's not a lot of money.

957
00:46:41,708 --> 00:46:44,748
I basically put whatever money I make
back in the theater.

958
00:46:44,833 --> 00:46:47,793
I wonder, do we ask for support?

959
00:46:48,250 --> 00:46:49,920
- Interesting.
- From Nicole?

960
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,380
I'm not going to do that.

961
00:46:51,875 --> 00:46:53,495
Does your wife's family have money?

962
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:57,710
Uh, her mother has some
from her TV career.

963
00:46:57,791 --> 00:46:59,131
And her father died.

964
00:46:59,208 --> 00:47:03,628
Well, we could say that we don't want
her mother to see the kid,

965
00:47:03,958 --> 00:47:05,288
draw her into the case.

966
00:47:05,375 --> 00:47:08,495
In that instance,
her mother could pay your legal fees.

967
00:47:08,958 --> 00:47:09,958
No.

968
00:47:10,583 --> 00:47:12,003
I'm very close to her mom.

969
00:47:12,375 --> 00:47:15,335
- Nicole's family has been my family...
- Yeah, but that's going to change.

970
00:47:15,375 --> 00:47:17,205
And I suggest you get used to it.

971
00:47:17,916 --> 00:47:21,746
- We need to hire a private investigator.
- Really? I mean...

972
00:47:23,291 --> 00:47:25,831
- Really?
- Does your wife do drugs or anything?

973
00:47:25,916 --> 00:47:26,916
Coke?

974
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:28,580
Not in any real way.

975
00:47:28,958 --> 00:47:31,668
Well, we're not going to win
if she's the perfect mother.

976
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:33,630
She was addicted to Tums for a while.

977
00:47:35,083 --> 00:47:38,213
It wasn't nothing.
She was up to a tube a day.

978
00:47:38,291 --> 00:47:40,081
Have you noticed anyone following you?

979
00:47:40,166 --> 00:47:41,166
No.

980
00:47:42,375 --> 00:47:43,745
Well, keep an eye out.

981
00:47:43,833 --> 00:47:46,003
Look, you need to be prepared for the fact

982
00:47:46,083 --> 00:47:50,173
that Nora is going to portray you
as a neglectful, absent father.

983
00:47:50,666 --> 00:47:52,876
- But I'm not.
- You live in New York.

984
00:47:52,958 --> 00:47:54,628
You're consumed with your work.

985
00:47:55,125 --> 00:47:58,535
She and your kid are out here, struggling.

986
00:47:58,625 --> 00:48:01,995
Nora's going to use that strategy.
I'm sure of it.

987
00:48:02,083 --> 00:48:03,283
But Nicole's not going to lie.

988
00:48:03,333 --> 00:48:06,213
Listen, if we start from a place
of reasonable,

989
00:48:06,291 --> 00:48:08,581
and they start from a place of crazy,

990
00:48:08,666 --> 00:48:12,706
when we settle, we'll be somewhere
between reasonable and crazy.

991
00:48:12,791 --> 00:48:13,671
Which is still crazy.

992
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:15,330
Half of crazy is crazy.

993
00:48:15,416 --> 00:48:18,476
You know what people say, "Criminal
lawyers see bad people at their best,

994
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:20,580
divorce lawyers see good people
at their worst."

995
00:48:20,666 --> 00:48:23,496
Before this is all over,
you're going to hate me and Ted,

996
00:48:23,583 --> 00:48:26,213
just because of what we represent
in your life.

997
00:48:26,291 --> 00:48:27,291
I'm sure you're right.

998
00:48:27,375 --> 00:48:29,875
So tell me the story again.
You came out here to see your kid.

999
00:48:29,958 --> 00:48:32,101
- Maybe I'm not explaining this well.
- She serves you.

1000
00:48:32,125 --> 00:48:33,809
- We're friendly, we're fine.
- What a bitch.

1001
00:48:33,833 --> 00:48:36,017
We're just trying to figure this out.
She's not a bitch.

1002
00:48:36,041 --> 00:48:37,291
Thanks, but this isn't...

1003
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:38,705
We're doing it a different way.

1004
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:41,793
And... I can't even close to afford this.

1005
00:48:42,166 --> 00:48:46,036
I've got to get back to New York.
I have a Broadway play in rehearsals.

1006
00:48:50,291 --> 00:48:53,751
I was the hot shit at that time.

1007
00:48:53,833 --> 00:48:58,793
Young, very sexy,
with a great head of hair.

1008
00:48:58,875 --> 00:49:01,495
I just so appreciate that Charlie
gave me this opportunity.

1009
00:49:01,583 --> 00:49:03,003
Or maybe I should thank Nicole.

1010
00:49:03,083 --> 00:49:05,633
I heard Nicole's pilot went to series,
so she's moving to LA.

1011
00:49:05,708 --> 00:49:07,288
And they put Henry in school out there.

1012
00:49:07,375 --> 00:49:08,575
Well, is Charlie moving too?

1013
00:49:08,666 --> 00:49:09,746
Not Charlie.

1014
00:49:09,833 --> 00:49:11,043
He won't abandon us.

1015
00:49:11,125 --> 00:49:12,745
And you can't do theater in LA.

1016
00:49:12,833 --> 00:49:15,213
Charlie said she and Henry
are coming back to New York

1017
00:49:15,291 --> 00:49:17,041
when she finishes filming her show.

1018
00:49:17,125 --> 00:49:18,535
I wouldn't be so sure.

1019
00:49:18,625 --> 00:49:21,535
Nicole was never going to stay
in New York, that was obvious.

1020
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:23,625
She was probably
planning this move all along.

1021
00:49:23,708 --> 00:49:27,038
When she sees an opportunity,
believe me, she takes it.

1022
00:49:27,125 --> 00:49:29,245
Well, LA is nice.

1023
00:49:29,666 --> 00:49:30,576
The space.

1024
00:49:30,666 --> 00:49:33,826
Miss Four Time Oscar winner, sucking my...

1025
00:49:33,916 --> 00:49:35,996
Okay, how is everyone today?

1026
00:49:36,083 --> 00:49:38,293
Nobody get too close.
I think I caught Donna's cold.

1027
00:49:38,375 --> 00:49:41,125
- Sorry, Charlie.
- I'm expecting a Skype call from Henry,

1028
00:49:41,208 --> 00:49:42,918
so I might have to step out.

1029
00:49:44,125 --> 00:49:46,455
So, Charlie, what you're going through now

1030
00:49:46,541 --> 00:49:49,831
is going to be horrible,
but it will be over.

1031
00:49:49,916 --> 00:49:51,076
Thanks, Frank.

1032
00:49:51,458 --> 00:49:52,668
- Another thing.
- Yeah?

1033
00:49:53,166 --> 00:49:57,286
Fuck as many people
as you can right now.

1034
00:49:57,375 --> 00:49:59,575
Women, men.

1035
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:02,809
- Take what I said seriously.
- You might need help wrapping gauze.

1036
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:05,543
- It needs to stay tight.
- Okay, I'm... I'm confused.

1037
00:50:05,625 --> 00:50:07,785
What... scene
is the Invisible Man outfit for?

1038
00:50:07,875 --> 00:50:09,825
No, that's my Halloween costume.

1039
00:50:09,916 --> 00:50:12,456
And the Frankenstein
is for Henry.

1040
00:50:14,208 --> 00:50:15,408
He's coming here this weekend.

1041
00:50:15,458 --> 00:50:17,328
We're going to trick or treat
in the Slope.

1042
00:50:17,416 --> 00:50:19,706
I made it more James Whale
than Kenneth Branagh.

1043
00:50:19,791 --> 00:50:21,541
- Perfect.
- Can I talk to you?

1044
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:23,960
Yeah, over...

1045
00:50:24,625 --> 00:50:26,995
I've typed up the blocking
from the last two rehearsals,

1046
00:50:27,083 --> 00:50:30,883
and here are the director notes
from that Danish production from the '70s.

1047
00:50:31,958 --> 00:50:32,878
Where'd you find it?

1048
00:50:32,958 --> 00:50:35,538
- The library, duh.
- Ha!

1049
00:50:35,875 --> 00:50:37,075
Can I come over tonight?

1050
00:50:38,416 --> 00:50:40,326
Mary Ann, it's too hard now.

1051
00:50:40,416 --> 00:50:42,496
I just can't be with anyone right now.

1052
00:50:42,583 --> 00:50:45,503
But we did it when you were married
and we shouldn't have done it.

1053
00:50:45,583 --> 00:50:47,851
And now that you're not married,
shouldn't we be doing it?

1054
00:50:47,875 --> 00:50:50,915
I'm not not married yet.

1055
00:50:51,375 --> 00:50:53,125
You're torturing yourself.

1056
00:50:53,375 --> 00:50:55,285
Just make sure
everything doesn't go to hell.

1057
00:50:56,541 --> 00:50:58,541
- I'm relying on you, okay?
- Fine.

1058
00:50:58,625 --> 00:51:01,205
- Thanks.
- I wish you'd accept generosity better.

1059
00:51:01,291 --> 00:51:02,541
Uh, hold on. Let me...

1060
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,920
- Hello?
- Is this Charlie Barber?

1061
00:51:05,416 --> 00:51:06,246
Yes.

1062
00:51:06,333 --> 00:51:08,133
Hi, this is Nora Fanshaw.

1063
00:51:08,208 --> 00:51:10,078
I represent your wife, Nicole Barber.

1064
00:51:10,166 --> 00:51:12,246
- Hi.
- Do you have an attorney yet?

1065
00:51:12,333 --> 00:51:13,173
No.

1066
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:15,809
Okay, then it's okay for me
to talk to you directly, okay?

1067
00:51:15,833 --> 00:51:16,833
Okay.

1068
00:51:17,166 --> 00:51:20,326
I'm calling because we haven't
received your response to our filing.

1069
00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:23,880
Yeah, I've been rehearsing this play
and flying back and forth to LA.

1070
00:51:23,958 --> 00:51:26,038
You're going to need
to file your response.

1071
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,750
- Nicole said there was no rush.
- It's been more than 30 days

1072
00:51:30,833 --> 00:51:31,833
since you were served.

1073
00:51:31,916 --> 00:51:33,756
By law, you're meant to respond
within 30 days.

1074
00:51:33,791 --> 00:51:35,271
I didn't like the first lawyer I met.

1075
00:51:35,333 --> 00:51:37,851
It says that very clearly
on the document you were given.

1076
00:51:37,875 --> 00:51:38,745
Did you read it?

1077
00:51:38,833 --> 00:51:40,593
Yeah, but I thought
that's just what it says.

1078
00:51:40,666 --> 00:51:42,416
We weren't even going to do it
with lawyers.

1079
00:51:43,416 --> 00:51:45,666
Charlie, I think I shouldn't
tuck in my shirt.

1080
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:48,726
- Nicole said I could take my time.
- And we've let you take your time.

1081
00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:51,934
- It comes out during the love scene.
- Could you hold a second? What love scene?

1082
00:51:51,958 --> 00:51:53,288
When I hug Beth.

1083
00:51:53,416 --> 00:51:54,416
You don't hug Beth.

1084
00:51:54,458 --> 00:51:56,788
I think it's something we should explore.

1085
00:51:56,875 --> 00:51:59,745
Can't you just tuck it in tighter
or get Donna to safety pin it?

1086
00:51:59,833 --> 00:52:01,713
I also have a kind of a thing

1087
00:52:01,791 --> 00:52:04,131
- about, uh, tucking things in.
- Charlie?

1088
00:52:04,416 --> 00:52:05,746
If you don't file your response,

1089
00:52:05,833 --> 00:52:08,313
we're going to file a request
for default judgment against you.

1090
00:52:08,666 --> 00:52:11,206
...insecurities about my figure.

1091
00:52:11,291 --> 00:52:12,501
- Charlie?
- Yes, sorry.

1092
00:52:12,583 --> 00:52:14,753
Default judgment, what does that mean?
Don't hug Beth.

1093
00:52:14,833 --> 00:52:16,934
We'll be able to lay claim
to whatever we want.

1094
00:52:16,958 --> 00:52:18,828
W-What do you mean,
whatever you want of what?

1095
00:52:18,916 --> 00:52:21,326
Your apartment, your things,
everything you own.

1096
00:52:21,416 --> 00:52:22,246
We...

1097
00:52:22,333 --> 00:52:25,173
She and I already discussed this.
We don't own that much stuff.

1098
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:26,970
She can have
pretty much whatever she wants.

1099
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,101
And it means we'll set the number
for child support at its highest level

1100
00:52:30,125 --> 00:52:31,995
and claim full custody of your child.

1101
00:52:34,083 --> 00:52:35,083
Full custody?

1102
00:52:36,833 --> 00:52:39,463
- I mean, that's not even...
- This is what the law says.

1103
00:52:40,416 --> 00:52:43,206
Nicole's not going to do that.
I mean, she won't.

1104
00:52:43,541 --> 00:52:45,291
No, Charlie, I represent Nicole,

1105
00:52:45,375 --> 00:52:47,665
and she's aware of everything
I'm saying to you.

1106
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:49,070
I just spoke to her this morning.

1107
00:52:49,125 --> 00:52:52,325
Well, I spoke to her five minutes
before I got on the call.

1108
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:56,750
Okay, so what do I do?

1109
00:52:56,833 --> 00:52:59,133
You need to get a lawyer
and respond immediately.

1110
00:52:59,208 --> 00:53:02,578
Nicole wants to do this amicably,
but you're leaving us no other option.

1111
00:53:02,666 --> 00:53:04,416
I'll get a lawyer.
Can I get a lawyer here?

1112
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:06,460
- I don't know where "here" is.
- New York.

1113
00:53:06,541 --> 00:53:08,881
Ah!
That's what all that honking is?

1114
00:53:09,583 --> 00:53:11,623
No, you'll have to come to LA
and meet people in LA.

1115
00:53:11,666 --> 00:53:12,666
I'm rehearsing a...

1116
00:53:12,708 --> 00:53:16,038
If you don't respond in Los Angeles
by Friday, you'll leave us no choice.

1117
00:53:16,125 --> 00:53:17,745
Wh... Which line?

1118
00:53:18,416 --> 00:53:21,126
I have to take this.
Can you hold on a second, Charlie?

1119
00:53:47,916 --> 00:53:51,036
Me and Mommy are in the middle
of a super secret treasure hunt.

1120
00:53:52,041 --> 00:53:54,581
- I thought the plane landed at nine.
- What are you wearing?

1121
00:53:54,666 --> 00:53:55,666
Sock pants.

1122
00:53:55,833 --> 00:53:57,423
It did. What are sock pants?

1123
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:59,420
He doesn't like to feel the breeze
on his legs.

1124
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:00,330
He dressed himself.

1125
00:54:00,416 --> 00:54:02,767
- There are long pants. Can I talk to you?
- It's almost noon.

1126
00:54:02,791 --> 00:54:04,671
There was traffic. We've got to get going.

1127
00:54:04,750 --> 00:54:07,434
- Why don't we ever do a treasure hunt?
- Henry, can you wait a minute?

1128
00:54:07,458 --> 00:54:08,708
No talking alone.

1129
00:54:08,791 --> 00:54:11,001
Just one bit of talking alone,
then I'll be right there.

1130
00:54:11,541 --> 00:54:12,831
I got a call from your lawyer.

1131
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:15,416
She said you'd take everything and...

1132
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:18,500
custody and everything
if I didn't respond.

1133
00:54:18,583 --> 00:54:20,423
It's better if we just
let the lawyers do this.

1134
00:54:20,458 --> 00:54:22,578
Yeah, but she's saying things
I don't think you mean.

1135
00:54:22,666 --> 00:54:24,326
Henry, we need to get going.

1136
00:54:24,416 --> 00:54:25,876
I don't want to go now.

1137
00:54:25,958 --> 00:54:28,309
- Have you gotten a lawyer yet?
- That's what I'm here to do.

1138
00:54:28,333 --> 00:54:29,883
Come on, Henry. I'm in a rush.

1139
00:54:29,958 --> 00:54:31,128
I have three more clues.

1140
00:54:31,208 --> 00:54:33,809
Why did you start a treasure hunt
or whatever so close to my arrival?

1141
00:54:33,833 --> 00:54:35,923
- Cool
- You were late. We were killing time.

1142
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,380
Honey, come. We're going to finish
the treasure hunt later.

1143
00:54:38,458 --> 00:54:40,038
- I'm going to be rich!
- Okay.

1144
00:54:40,125 --> 00:54:42,351
You're going to go with your daddy,
it's going to be fun.

1145
00:54:42,375 --> 00:54:45,625
And I've got a present for you
when you get back as a reward.

1146
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:47,700
He's not going to the dentist.

1147
00:54:47,750 --> 00:54:49,710
- I'm trying to help.
- I'm staying here.

1148
00:54:49,791 --> 00:54:50,791
Come on.

1149
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:55,625
Henry?

1150
00:55:01,083 --> 00:55:03,583
- Got the booster?
- I have a booster.

1151
00:55:05,375 --> 00:55:06,995
Oh, wait, no, it's not in.

1152
00:55:07,375 --> 00:55:08,375
What's not in?

1153
00:55:08,708 --> 00:55:10,708
The seat's not connected.

1154
00:55:13,833 --> 00:55:15,503
I asked the rental company to install it.

1155
00:55:15,583 --> 00:55:18,333
Yeah, I think they can't
for liability reasons.

1156
00:55:18,583 --> 00:55:20,809
- Do you know how these things...
- Let me just... If you...

1157
00:55:20,833 --> 00:55:23,543
- There should be a clip to clip onto.
- ...dig...

1158
00:55:28,291 --> 00:55:29,831
Ow! Fuck!

1159
00:55:29,916 --> 00:55:31,706
- Why "fuck?"
- Something sharp.

1160
00:55:31,791 --> 00:55:33,171
- Can't I stay with Mom?
- No.

1161
00:55:33,250 --> 00:55:34,290
Why not?

1162
00:55:34,375 --> 00:55:36,375
It's my time with you.
I just flew 3,000 miles.

1163
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:37,328
I don't want to.

1164
00:55:37,416 --> 00:55:38,916
Henry, get in the fucking car!

1165
00:55:41,083 --> 00:55:43,333
I'm sorry, but Jesus,
get in the fucking car.

1166
00:55:48,416 --> 00:55:50,576
How do you spell Lego Bionicles?

1167
00:55:50,666 --> 00:55:53,036
That's two words.
What does Lego start with?

1168
00:55:53,125 --> 00:55:54,165
Just tell me.

1169
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:55,559
- Don't you want to learn it?
- No.

1170
00:55:55,583 --> 00:55:56,963
- It's on the box, anyway.
- L...

1171
00:55:57,041 --> 00:55:58,041
Then what?

1172
00:55:58,208 --> 00:56:00,998
E... You know,
everyone at the theater says hi.

1173
00:56:01,083 --> 00:56:02,003
Hi.

1174
00:56:02,083 --> 00:56:02,963
Then what?

1175
00:56:03,041 --> 00:56:04,581
A "g-g-g" sound.

1176
00:56:04,666 --> 00:56:06,626
- Are you excited for Halloween?
- J?

1177
00:56:06,708 --> 00:56:07,538
G.

1178
00:56:07,625 --> 00:56:09,285
- Then what?
- And an "O" sound.

1179
00:56:09,375 --> 00:56:11,495
- O?
- Are you excited for Halloween?

1180
00:56:11,583 --> 00:56:12,503
Yeah.

1181
00:56:12,583 --> 00:56:14,083
I brought both our costumes.

1182
00:56:14,166 --> 00:56:16,456
I'm going as a store-bought ninja.

1183
00:56:16,541 --> 00:56:18,671
But we agreed.
I had Donna make you a Frankenstein.

1184
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:20,920
I don't want to be a Frankenstein anymore.

1185
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Are you sure?

1186
00:56:23,666 --> 00:56:24,706
Maybe just look at it.

1187
00:56:25,250 --> 00:56:27,880
It's awesome. We'll be Frankenstein
and the Invisible Man.

1188
00:56:27,958 --> 00:56:29,958
Mom bought me a ninja costume,

1189
00:56:30,166 --> 00:56:32,746
which is better because it costs more.

1190
00:56:32,833 --> 00:56:34,423
Technically, the Frankenstein cost more

1191
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:36,630
when you factor in Donna's time
and the materials.

1192
00:56:36,708 --> 00:56:38,958
The cousins are also going to be ninjas.

1193
00:56:39,041 --> 00:56:40,881
But Henry,
we went through all this trouble.

1194
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:45,540
Okay.

1195
00:56:45,625 --> 00:56:46,625
Whatever you want.

1196
00:56:51,166 --> 00:56:53,876
Please take the ticket.

1197
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,892
- Dad, you're too far.
- I know.

1198
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:02,576
Please take the ticket.

1199
00:57:09,291 --> 00:57:11,581
So, I'm not comfortable
leaving the bags in the car

1200
00:57:11,666 --> 00:57:13,851
where I've given the key to someone
I don't really know.

1201
00:57:13,875 --> 00:57:14,875
I've been here.

1202
00:57:15,125 --> 00:57:18,455
It's an office building,
so you've been to places like this before.

1203
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,580
I remember those fish.

1204
00:57:21,708 --> 00:57:23,128
A lot of fish look the same.

1205
00:57:23,708 --> 00:57:24,708
Can I help you?

1206
00:57:24,750 --> 00:57:27,250
I'm Charlie Barber.
I have a 1:30 with Dan Cohen.

1207
00:57:27,333 --> 00:57:29,083
Oh, hi. Where's your little man?

1208
00:57:29,166 --> 00:57:32,326
I don't have it this time.
I keep my skeletons at my mom's.

1209
00:57:32,708 --> 00:57:33,708
Okay.

1210
00:57:35,041 --> 00:57:36,041
Oh, okay.

1211
00:57:36,250 --> 00:57:38,170
I'm sorry. We tried to reach you.

1212
00:57:38,250 --> 00:57:40,040
Mr. Cohen wanted me to apologize.

1213
00:57:40,125 --> 00:57:43,285
He can't see you because apparently
your wife already met with him

1214
00:57:43,375 --> 00:57:45,625
on the 7th of August about representation.

1215
00:57:46,291 --> 00:57:47,791
B-But she hired somebody else.

1216
00:57:47,875 --> 00:57:50,205
- Uh... Nora...
- Fanshaw?

1217
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:53,020
But unfortunately, because she consulted
with Mr. Cohen already,

1218
00:57:53,083 --> 00:57:55,083
he's legally barred from representing you.

1219
00:57:55,791 --> 00:57:56,631
Oh.

1220
00:57:56,708 --> 00:57:58,348
- Should we feed the fish?
- Yeah.

1221
00:57:58,958 --> 00:58:01,378
- It happens all the time.
- Really?

1222
00:58:01,458 --> 00:58:03,748
If you have a ticket,
I can validate your parking.

1223
00:58:04,291 --> 00:58:05,291
Oh.

1224
00:58:05,375 --> 00:58:08,434
You know, it's common that people
meet with as many lawyers as possible

1225
00:58:08,458 --> 00:58:10,378
so that their spouse has limited options.

1226
00:58:10,458 --> 00:58:12,498
Oh, I don't think
she would've done it deliberately.

1227
00:58:12,541 --> 00:58:13,921
You'd be surprised.

1228
00:58:14,166 --> 00:58:16,706
Can all of them, like,
breathe out of the water?

1229
00:58:18,416 --> 00:58:20,496
Did you go to a lot of offices
with your mom?

1230
00:58:20,583 --> 00:58:21,713
Not so many.

1231
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:24,333
Like 11.

1232
00:58:24,708 --> 00:58:27,248
I don't think anyone
would have stealed the bags, Daddy.

1233
00:58:27,333 --> 00:58:28,503
I need somebody today.

1234
00:58:28,583 --> 00:58:31,293
If I don't respond by tomorrow,
she said I could lose custody.

1235
00:58:31,375 --> 00:58:34,267
I didn't know who else to call.
There's got to be someone she didn't meet.

1236
00:58:34,291 --> 00:58:35,421
I have a name for you.

1237
00:58:36,458 --> 00:58:38,328
Bert Spitz.

1238
00:58:38,875 --> 00:58:42,165
He was the entertainment lawyer
at Roberto's agency.

1239
00:58:42,625 --> 00:58:43,455
Great.

1240
00:58:43,541 --> 00:58:47,001
But then he kind of got pushed
into retirement a few years ago,

1241
00:58:47,291 --> 00:58:49,081
and he went into family law.

1242
00:58:49,166 --> 00:58:50,996
- I called him.
- Thank you, G-ma.

1243
00:58:51,083 --> 00:58:53,753
- He can see you today at three.
- Aw, shit.

1244
00:58:54,416 --> 00:58:56,956
We never had this conversation,
Charlie-bird.

1245
00:58:57,041 --> 00:58:58,392
You got it. I love you.

1246
00:58:58,416 --> 00:58:59,416
- Aw.
- Dad!

1247
00:58:59,458 --> 00:59:02,038
- I need a new burger.
- Why?

1248
00:59:02,125 --> 00:59:06,415
Because you made us carry your bags
into the restaurant, I dropped it.

1249
00:59:07,916 --> 00:59:10,286
That's fine. I'll give you mine.
Get in the car.

1250
00:59:10,375 --> 00:59:13,325
Why did you bring me today
if you couldn't hang out with me?

1251
00:59:13,416 --> 00:59:15,326
Because I've been away
and want to see you.

1252
00:59:16,083 --> 00:59:19,383
Jamie Tuber has a little sister

1253
00:59:19,458 --> 00:59:21,958
named, um, Lily Tuber.

1254
00:59:22,041 --> 00:59:24,331
- Yeah.
- And Lily Tuber is really bossy.

1255
00:59:24,416 --> 00:59:25,246
Uh-huh.

1256
00:59:26,583 --> 00:59:30,333
Getting divorced with a kid can be
one of the hardest things you'll ever do.

1257
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,880
It's like a death without a body.

1258
00:59:36,041 --> 00:59:39,331
I know personally.
I've been there four different times.

1259
00:59:39,416 --> 00:59:41,036
You've been divorced four times?

1260
00:59:41,125 --> 00:59:42,245
Married four times.

1261
00:59:42,666 --> 00:59:43,826
Three divorces.

1262
00:59:44,875 --> 00:59:47,205
This last one will stick, God willing.

1263
00:59:47,291 --> 00:59:49,671
That's why I graduated into family law,

1264
00:59:49,958 --> 00:59:52,208
to help people survive this painful time.

1265
00:59:53,958 --> 00:59:55,168
Here's how I see it.

1266
00:59:56,583 --> 00:59:59,543
If we get bogged down
in "who did this," and "who did that,"

1267
00:59:59,625 --> 01:00:01,305
and "I don't want to pay the two dollars,"

1268
01:00:01,333 --> 01:00:04,003
it'll just cost you more money
and time and...

1269
01:00:05,041 --> 01:00:06,131
emotional stress,

1270
01:00:06,208 --> 01:00:08,628
and you'll probably end up
with the same result anyway.

1271
01:00:08,708 --> 01:00:09,708
Right.

1272
01:00:09,958 --> 01:00:12,828
I mean, I agree with that philosophy.
She does too, I'm sure.

1273
01:00:12,916 --> 01:00:15,996
And I always go with the truth,
no matter where that takes us.

1274
01:00:16,333 --> 01:00:18,453
You know, most people in my business
make up the truth

1275
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:20,020
so they can get where they need to go.

1276
01:00:20,541 --> 01:00:22,671
You're just transactions to them.

1277
01:00:22,750 --> 01:00:24,630
I-I like to think of you as people.

1278
01:00:24,708 --> 01:00:26,498
Oh, okay, good.

1279
01:00:26,583 --> 01:00:28,043
And not just you, her too.

1280
01:00:28,125 --> 01:00:28,955
Yes.

1281
01:00:29,041 --> 01:00:31,171
You know, this can be
a really ugly process.

1282
01:00:31,250 --> 01:00:33,920
But I also believe
it doesn't have to be terrible.

1283
01:00:34,208 --> 01:00:35,578
I'm glad to hear you say that.

1284
01:00:36,125 --> 01:00:37,125
Um...

1285
01:00:37,708 --> 01:00:40,078
I'd love to keep expenses down
as much as possible.

1286
01:00:40,166 --> 01:00:41,166
Of course you do.

1287
01:00:41,750 --> 01:00:45,750
I charge 450 an hour
and I need a $10,000 retainer to start.

1288
01:00:46,750 --> 01:00:49,460
I'll see if I can get an advance
on the Broadway transfer.

1289
01:00:49,541 --> 01:00:52,291
And keep in mind,
you'll have to pay for her lawyer.

1290
01:00:52,375 --> 01:00:53,825
Oh. I didn't...

1291
01:00:56,375 --> 01:00:58,285
- What?
- Well, at least part of her.

1292
01:00:58,375 --> 01:00:59,955
It doesn't make sense, does it?

1293
01:01:00,333 --> 01:01:03,383
I mean, you're doing this
because you love your kid.

1294
01:01:04,041 --> 01:01:07,331
And in doing so, you're draining money
from your kid's education.

1295
01:01:07,416 --> 01:01:09,376
- It seems ridiculous.
- Oh, it is.

1296
01:01:09,541 --> 01:01:10,791
It is, boy.

1297
01:01:12,375 --> 01:01:14,165
We'll have to respond right away.

1298
01:01:15,791 --> 01:01:17,461
Your son goes to school out here?

1299
01:01:17,541 --> 01:01:19,791
Yeah, temporarily. We agreed.

1300
01:01:20,250 --> 01:01:22,830
Her pilot went to series
and I wanted to accommodate her,

1301
01:01:22,916 --> 01:01:25,036
as she's often felt
we do things on my terms.

1302
01:01:25,125 --> 01:01:27,375
Be a better husband in divorce.

1303
01:01:27,708 --> 01:01:30,378
I guess something like that,
but we live in New York.

1304
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:33,380
Well, with your kid
going to school out here,

1305
01:01:33,458 --> 01:01:34,918
the court may see it differently.

1306
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,040
Will we go to court?

1307
01:01:36,125 --> 01:01:38,125
No, no, we don't want to go to court.

1308
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:40,290
The courts in California are a disaster.

1309
01:01:40,375 --> 01:01:42,415
No, that's just how
we have to think about it.

1310
01:01:42,916 --> 01:01:44,666
I'm not sure these are my glasses.

1311
01:01:45,041 --> 01:01:46,751
Where are you living while you're here?

1312
01:01:46,833 --> 01:01:48,133
I'm in a hotel right now.

1313
01:01:48,208 --> 01:01:49,418
No, a hotel doesn't look good.

1314
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:50,960
- To who?
- The court.

1315
01:01:51,041 --> 01:01:52,961
You just said
we weren't going to go to court.

1316
01:01:53,041 --> 01:01:54,321
No, of course, of course.

1317
01:01:54,375 --> 01:01:56,875
We have to prepare to go to court,
hoping we don't go to court.

1318
01:01:56,958 --> 01:01:57,958
Okay.

1319
01:01:58,291 --> 01:01:59,751
You should get a place in LA.

1320
01:02:00,291 --> 01:02:02,921
And get a place near her.
It looks better for custody reasons.

1321
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,290
She's in West Hollywood.
That'll be expensive.

1322
01:02:05,375 --> 01:02:07,285
I-I guess I could rent
our New York apartment.

1323
01:02:07,375 --> 01:02:08,375
Don't rent it.

1324
01:02:08,708 --> 01:02:10,958
You have to continue to prove
New York residence.

1325
01:02:11,041 --> 01:02:13,171
And of course, if you have a place in LA,

1326
01:02:13,250 --> 01:02:15,630
it's hard to show you all live
in New York, isn't it?

1327
01:02:15,708 --> 01:02:16,708
So...

1328
01:02:17,625 --> 01:02:18,745
what do I do?

1329
01:02:18,875 --> 01:02:22,205
I recommend you spend
as much time as you can with your son.

1330
01:02:23,125 --> 01:02:25,075
Many people fight for that time,

1331
01:02:25,166 --> 01:02:26,576
then they don't even use it.

1332
01:02:27,125 --> 01:02:28,325
They just want to win.

1333
01:02:28,583 --> 01:02:31,133
This shouldn't be
that complicated, right?

1334
01:02:31,208 --> 01:02:32,828
I mean, we're a New York family.

1335
01:02:33,083 --> 01:02:35,583
I think it's all
pretty straightforward. Right?

1336
01:02:35,666 --> 01:02:37,706
I hope so, yes.

1337
01:02:38,625 --> 01:02:40,075
I see no reason...

1338
01:02:40,833 --> 01:02:42,963
You both love your child.

1339
01:02:43,958 --> 01:02:45,128
You respect each other.

1340
01:02:45,458 --> 01:02:47,628
Why this shouldn't be
relatively pain-free.

1341
01:02:47,708 --> 01:02:48,788
Right.

1342
01:02:48,875 --> 01:02:50,785
I think you have my glasses.

1343
01:02:53,250 --> 01:02:54,460
That makes sense.

1344
01:02:55,458 --> 01:02:58,168
- What have you been doing?
- Reading this magazine.

1345
01:02:58,250 --> 01:03:00,210
You were reading California Lawyer?

1346
01:03:00,291 --> 01:03:01,131
Yeah.

1347
01:03:01,208 --> 01:03:03,878
Okay, I'm almost done.

1348
01:03:04,291 --> 01:03:06,381
I wouldn't expect too much from that cat.

1349
01:03:08,541 --> 01:03:11,171
- What kind of pet do you want?
- I don't know...

1350
01:03:11,250 --> 01:03:14,000
I want you to know
that eventually this will all be over,

1351
01:03:14,083 --> 01:03:15,883
and whatever we win or lose...

1352
01:03:16,458 --> 01:03:19,378
it'll be the two of you
having to figure this out together.

1353
01:03:20,083 --> 01:03:21,083
Thank you.

1354
01:03:21,250 --> 01:03:25,000
You're the first person in this process
who's spoken to me like a human.

1355
01:03:30,083 --> 01:03:32,633
You remind me of myself
on my second marriage.

1356
01:03:36,666 --> 01:03:38,626
Come! Come! Come! Come! Oh!

1357
01:03:38,708 --> 01:03:40,288
You have fun with Daddy?

1358
01:03:40,375 --> 01:03:42,495
- We drove around to offices.
- Oh.

1359
01:03:42,583 --> 01:03:45,423
Do you want to see your ninja costume?
It's on G-ma's bed.

1360
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:46,750
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

1361
01:03:48,625 --> 01:03:51,535
You know, I had Donna build him
this whole Frankenstein thing

1362
01:03:51,625 --> 01:03:53,125
with the plugs and...

1363
01:03:53,208 --> 01:03:55,648
Yeah, well, the cousins are ninjas,
so he wanted to do that...

1364
01:03:55,708 --> 01:03:57,538
But he and I had decided together.

1365
01:03:57,625 --> 01:03:59,305
Oh, well, I can't make him
be Frankenstein.

1366
01:03:59,375 --> 01:04:01,809
I'm not asking you to,
but maybe you can help me out a little.

1367
01:04:01,833 --> 01:04:04,833
I'll leave the Frankenstein here, maybe
you can nudge him in that direction.

1368
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:06,250
I'll try.

1369
01:04:07,708 --> 01:04:08,708
What's the...

1370
01:04:09,791 --> 01:04:11,791
Did you dye your hair again?
Is that for your show?

1371
01:04:12,291 --> 01:04:14,921
No, this is me. It was this way
when I saw you before.

1372
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,790
I know, but I didn't say anything then.

1373
01:04:17,958 --> 01:04:19,128
You don't like it?

1374
01:04:19,208 --> 01:04:22,498
No, I guess it's fine.
Is it shorter? I prefer longer but...

1375
01:04:25,333 --> 01:04:27,543
Oh, sorry, it's just absurd.

1376
01:04:28,166 --> 01:04:29,246
Is everything okay?

1377
01:04:29,333 --> 01:04:30,963
Yeah. Why?

1378
01:04:31,458 --> 01:04:33,998
You seem, I don't know,
like something is...

1379
01:04:34,083 --> 01:04:35,213
Everything's fine.

1380
01:04:37,208 --> 01:04:38,918
Okay, I'm going to check in at the hotel,

1381
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,960
but I should be able to get to you guys
by 5:00, 5:30...

1382
01:04:42,041 --> 01:04:44,501
We're going to Cassie's
in Pasadena

1383
01:04:44,583 --> 01:04:46,293
and trick-or-treating with the cousins.

1384
01:04:46,375 --> 01:04:47,535
Cassie lives in Pasadena now?

1385
01:04:47,625 --> 01:04:49,875
Yes. She and Sam moved there
a couple months ago.

1386
01:04:49,958 --> 01:04:51,358
Okay, I don't really know Pasadena.

1387
01:04:51,416 --> 01:04:54,392
- I'll figure it out. What's the address?
- My mom is looking forward to it...

1388
01:04:54,416 --> 01:04:56,416
- I'll text Sam.
- ...and Cassie and Sam are mad.

1389
01:04:56,500 --> 01:04:57,830
- Mad at who?
- You.

1390
01:04:57,916 --> 01:05:00,076
- Cassie and Sam?
- You can understand that.

1391
01:05:00,166 --> 01:05:02,376
So, I think we should probably do
separate Halloweens.

1392
01:05:02,458 --> 01:05:04,978
But if you're okay with it,
then shouldn't they be okay with it?

1393
01:05:05,041 --> 01:05:07,351
- Let's do it this way this time.
- Do you not want me there?

1394
01:05:07,375 --> 01:05:08,245
I'm fine with it.

1395
01:05:08,333 --> 01:05:10,293
- Okay.
- It'll be nice for him.

1396
01:05:10,375 --> 01:05:11,705
He'll have two Halloweens.

1397
01:05:12,625 --> 01:05:15,995
What am I going to do with him for second
Halloween? Walk around Sunset Boulevard?

1398
01:05:16,083 --> 01:05:19,793
Maybe the hotel has something. Or you can
drive to a different neighborhood.

1399
01:05:23,416 --> 01:05:26,326
The sun sets forever.

1400
01:05:27,583 --> 01:05:30,503
There shall never be another dawn.

1401
01:05:31,625 --> 01:05:32,455
No!

1402
01:05:34,208 --> 01:05:35,998
Lady...

1403
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:39,500
I require the solace of the shadows...

1404
01:05:40,541 --> 01:05:41,881
and the dark!

1405
01:06:01,250 --> 01:06:04,330
Okay, ready for Halloween?

1406
01:06:05,083 --> 01:06:06,793
- Hi.
- Wow, elaborate.

1407
01:06:07,250 --> 01:06:09,809
Sweetheart, don't forget to wear
your jacket. It's getting colder.

1408
01:06:09,833 --> 01:06:11,976
- This is a nice house.
- Ready to go back out?

1409
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,476
- He has to pee.
- No, I don't.

1410
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:14,500
He does.

1411
01:06:14,750 --> 01:06:16,960
Uh, some of his men are in here
and also Bear-Bear.

1412
01:06:17,041 --> 01:06:19,184
You can keep that Bear-Bear,
because I got another one.

1413
01:06:19,208 --> 01:06:20,888
Does he know
that there are two Bear-Bears?

1414
01:06:20,916 --> 01:06:23,416
- It was his idea.
- David Bowie, right? Station to Station?

1415
01:06:24,041 --> 01:06:25,041
Let's Dance.

1416
01:06:25,625 --> 01:06:28,325
Henry, have a great Halloween
with Daddy, okay?

1417
01:06:30,250 --> 01:06:31,250
Have fun.

1418
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:36,380
Go pee and then we're going back out.

1419
01:06:36,791 --> 01:06:38,351
I'm too tired.

1420
01:06:38,375 --> 01:06:40,915
Go pee, and then
we're going to go drive to Halloween.

1421
01:06:41,333 --> 01:06:43,173
This block looks promising.

1422
01:06:43,958 --> 01:06:45,288
I wish Halloween was over.

1423
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:46,785
Well, it isn't.

1424
01:06:47,125 --> 01:06:49,455
If we were in New York,
we could be walking.

1425
01:06:49,666 --> 01:06:52,666
But I like that we're sitting right now.
I like to sit.

1426
01:06:53,125 --> 01:06:56,495
That's true, Los Angeles
does have sitting going for it.

1427
01:06:56,875 --> 01:06:59,455
I think that's why
I like Los Angeles better.

1428
01:06:59,541 --> 01:07:00,631
Because you get to sit?

1429
01:07:00,708 --> 01:07:02,828
No, because I like my friends here better.

1430
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,130
That's not true.

1431
01:07:04,833 --> 01:07:07,253
What about Horatio and Poppy?

1432
01:07:07,333 --> 01:07:09,333
Horatio doesn't like me anymore.

1433
01:07:09,791 --> 01:07:11,131
And I don't like Poppy.

1434
01:07:11,583 --> 01:07:12,963
Here, I have Axel.

1435
01:07:13,041 --> 01:07:15,791
Axel's hilarious.
I think you'd like him, Dad.

1436
01:07:16,791 --> 01:07:18,171
And my family's here.

1437
01:07:19,375 --> 01:07:20,375
Besides you.

1438
01:07:48,416 --> 01:07:49,536
Everyone's asleep.

1439
01:08:41,041 --> 01:08:42,041
I need to pee!

1440
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:50,170
Who gave you a lighter?

1441
01:08:53,416 --> 01:08:54,416
Lift the seat.

1442
01:09:00,666 --> 01:09:02,746
I'm going to have to go back to New York
on Monday.

1443
01:09:03,250 --> 01:09:04,290
Did you flush?

1444
01:09:11,083 --> 01:09:12,083
Wash your hands.

1445
01:09:13,750 --> 01:09:15,290
Will you play with me?

1446
01:09:16,291 --> 01:09:17,791
I'm tired, honey.

1447
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:32,246
Did you hear me?
I have to go back to New York.

1448
01:09:32,333 --> 01:09:34,463
Ah, watch out!
Whoosh! I'm falling!

1449
01:09:36,958 --> 01:09:39,788
You didn't catch me.

1450
01:09:42,708 --> 01:09:43,708
Okay?

1451
01:09:44,541 --> 01:09:45,791
Why aren't you here more?

1452
01:09:47,375 --> 01:09:49,325
I have to work.

1453
01:09:49,666 --> 01:09:51,666
You know my play is opening on Broadway.

1454
01:09:52,375 --> 01:09:54,325
Is it because you don't want to be
near Mom?

1455
01:09:54,416 --> 01:09:56,496
No. You know,
like we talked about,

1456
01:09:56,583 --> 01:09:59,133
we both decided not to be together
no matter where we are,

1457
01:09:59,208 --> 01:10:00,828
but we both want to be with you.

1458
01:10:01,666 --> 01:10:04,036
But you're not near me
if you're in New York.

1459
01:10:04,583 --> 01:10:06,423
Well, we all still live in New York.

1460
01:10:07,083 --> 01:10:08,923
Yeah, but I go to school here.

1461
01:10:09,583 --> 01:10:10,633
Just for right now.

1462
01:10:11,541 --> 01:10:13,921
Like that time we were in Copenhagen
for my play.

1463
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,420
Remember all those kids in buckets?

1464
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:17,670
I like my school here,

1465
01:10:17,750 --> 01:10:20,290
and Mom says we could stay here
if we want.

1466
01:10:22,208 --> 01:10:23,208
What do you mean?

1467
01:10:25,250 --> 01:10:26,250
She said that?

1468
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:27,330
Yeah.

1469
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,170
Vroom.

1470
01:10:37,208 --> 01:10:38,208
Aah!

1471
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,540
- Hello?
- Are you moving out here?

1472
01:10:58,625 --> 01:11:01,392
- Did you find a lawyer?
- Yes. Henry says you're moving here.

1473
01:11:01,416 --> 01:11:02,666
Have your lawyer call Nora.

1474
01:11:02,750 --> 01:11:04,080
I want to talk about it as us.

1475
01:11:04,166 --> 01:11:05,166
Who the fuck is "us"?

1476
01:11:05,250 --> 01:11:07,330
Let's just get in a room,
you and me.

1477
01:11:07,416 --> 01:11:08,956
That's what we always said we'd do.

1478
01:11:09,041 --> 01:11:11,434
- My lawyers wouldn't let me sign anything.
- It's our divorce.

1479
01:11:11,458 --> 01:11:13,668
They say I could later sue them
for malpractice.

1480
01:11:14,666 --> 01:11:15,996
What am I walking into?

1481
01:11:16,083 --> 01:11:17,463
What are you walking into?

1482
01:11:17,541 --> 01:11:19,171
Yes, what the fuck is going on?!

1483
01:11:19,250 --> 01:11:22,880
I read your fucking emails, Charlie!
I read them all.

1484
01:11:23,416 --> 01:11:25,056
- When?
- I don't know, recently.

1485
01:11:25,125 --> 01:11:26,684
- Shit.
- You're a fucking liar.

1486
01:11:26,708 --> 01:11:29,378
- You fucked Mary Ann!
- It was after I was sleeping on the couch.

1487
01:11:29,458 --> 01:11:31,128
All this bullshit about working on us.

1488
01:11:31,208 --> 01:11:33,078
You know what? I have been working.

1489
01:11:33,166 --> 01:11:34,826
I've been doing the work alone.

1490
01:11:34,916 --> 01:11:36,246
How did you read my emails?

1491
01:11:36,333 --> 01:11:38,713
I hacked into your account, you dumb fuck!

1492
01:11:38,791 --> 01:11:39,921
I think that's illegal!

1493
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,580
Don't give me this shit
about being surprised about LA.

1494
01:11:42,666 --> 01:11:44,326
Surprise! I have my own opinions.

1495
01:11:44,416 --> 01:11:46,576
How do you even know
how to do something like that?

1496
01:11:46,666 --> 01:11:48,626
Surprise! I want things
that aren't what you want,

1497
01:11:48,666 --> 01:11:50,586
because, surprise,
you were fucking another lady.

1498
01:11:50,625 --> 01:11:53,745
It was one time! I think you're conflating
two different things.

1499
01:11:53,833 --> 01:11:55,463
Mary Ann has nothing to do with LA.

1500
01:11:55,541 --> 01:11:57,131
I am conflating, motherfucker!

1501
01:11:57,208 --> 01:11:58,668
You watch me conflate!

1502
01:12:02,916 --> 01:12:04,496
Did you just stamp your foot?

1503
01:12:04,958 --> 01:12:07,748
I don't think I've ever done that before.
I'm just so angry.

1504
01:12:10,083 --> 01:12:13,003
- You look like you needed one.
- Yes, I do, thanks.

1505
01:12:14,041 --> 01:12:17,041
You know, the Japanese are making
really interesting tequila right now.

1506
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:19,000
That's exciting, I guess.

1507
01:12:20,250 --> 01:12:22,880
- What are you so angry about?
- My fucking ex-husband.

1508
01:12:23,416 --> 01:12:26,746
I spent all this time feeling guilty,
and he's so self-absorbed.

1509
01:12:26,833 --> 01:12:27,833
It's pointless.

1510
01:12:28,291 --> 01:12:30,171
It's a game I'm playing with myself.

1511
01:12:31,333 --> 01:12:34,383
Oh, hey, Pablo. Uh, we met at...

1512
01:12:34,458 --> 01:12:36,498
- You held the bounce board.
- The flirty grip.

1513
01:12:40,166 --> 01:12:42,536
- Here's what I want you to only do, okay?
- What?

1514
01:12:42,708 --> 01:12:44,878
- I want you to finger me.
- What?

1515
01:12:44,958 --> 01:12:46,828
- Just finger me.
- Okay.

1516
01:12:46,916 --> 01:12:49,746
That's all we're going to do,
just fingering. Okay?

1517
01:12:50,375 --> 01:12:52,125
I'm changing my whole fucking life.

1518
01:12:58,208 --> 01:13:01,788
Nicole and Charlie's son, Henry,
was born here in Los Angeles.

1519
01:13:01,875 --> 01:13:05,035
He currently attends Laurel Elementary
in Laurel Canyon,

1520
01:13:05,125 --> 01:13:06,955
and Nicole works in Hollywood

1521
01:13:07,041 --> 01:13:09,631
while also maintaining a full schedule
as a mother

1522
01:13:10,041 --> 01:13:12,831
with classes of swim, art,

1523
01:13:12,916 --> 01:13:15,706
gym, and music, as well as play groups.

1524
01:13:16,666 --> 01:13:19,746
Nicole is Henry's
primary custodial parent,

1525
01:13:19,833 --> 01:13:24,213
and to the extent that Charlie
would like to exercise his custodial time,

1526
01:13:24,291 --> 01:13:27,581
he should be making efforts
to visit Henry here in California.

1527
01:13:27,666 --> 01:13:29,456
Nora, you seem to be
ignoring the fact

1528
01:13:29,541 --> 01:13:32,711
that they lived in New York for ten years.

1529
01:13:32,916 --> 01:13:36,246
My client worked in New York
for several years, that's true.

1530
01:13:36,333 --> 01:13:38,633
But Nicole was born and bred
right here in LA.

1531
01:13:39,166 --> 01:13:42,376
She and Charlie would come here
most holidays and summers

1532
01:13:42,458 --> 01:13:43,748
to spend time with her family,

1533
01:13:43,833 --> 01:13:45,293
who all live in LA.

1534
01:13:45,791 --> 01:13:47,791
She and Charlie were married in LA.

1535
01:13:48,541 --> 01:13:49,861
Would you like to see the photos?

1536
01:13:49,916 --> 01:13:51,826
No, I don't need to see the photos.

1537
01:13:52,291 --> 01:13:54,421
Although I'm sure
they both look beautiful.

1538
01:13:55,625 --> 01:13:57,665
It's my client's expectation

1539
01:13:57,916 --> 01:14:00,416
that after this TV show is completed,

1540
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:02,460
the parties will move back to New York

1541
01:14:02,541 --> 01:14:04,331
where they currently keep an apartment.

1542
01:14:04,416 --> 01:14:07,536
And it's my understanding
that Charlie promised Nicole

1543
01:14:07,625 --> 01:14:10,915
that they would spend more time
in Los Angeles during the marriage.

1544
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,920
But because of his insistence
that his work keep them in New York,

1545
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:17,880
Nicole ended up staying there much longer
than she ever anticipated.

1546
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:21,250
In fact, a few years ago,

1547
01:14:21,541 --> 01:14:24,921
Charlie was offered a residency
at the Geffen Playhouse

1548
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,670
that would have taken his work
and his family

1549
01:14:28,083 --> 01:14:30,083
to Los Angeles for a year.

1550
01:14:30,833 --> 01:14:32,543
And he, um...

1551
01:14:32,625 --> 01:14:33,665
turned it down.

1552
01:14:34,208 --> 01:14:36,208
Even though that was Nicole's desire.

1553
01:14:36,291 --> 01:14:40,421
He wanted to maintain consistency
for his family and his child.

1554
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:42,630
Was this the same consistency
he wanted to maintain

1555
01:14:42,708 --> 01:14:46,168
when they went to Copenhagen
for six months so he could direct a play?

1556
01:14:46,250 --> 01:14:49,330
Now, while I understand
Charlie lives in New York...

1557
01:14:49,916 --> 01:14:53,706
and when it's convenient to his work
schedule, he flies out to see his son...

1558
01:14:53,791 --> 01:14:56,251
He flies out here every chance he gets,
at great expense.

1559
01:14:56,333 --> 01:14:58,543
I don't see any reason
you can't be out here full time.

1560
01:14:58,625 --> 01:15:00,184
He makes his living in New York.

1561
01:15:00,208 --> 01:15:02,748
- Sorry, do we want to contemplate lunch?
- Good idea.

1562
01:15:02,833 --> 01:15:04,833
I'll order now so it'll come
when we're all hungry.

1563
01:15:04,916 --> 01:15:05,916
Yeah. Mm.

1564
01:15:05,958 --> 01:15:08,059
- Everyone good with Manny's?
- I'd love Manny's.

1565
01:15:08,083 --> 01:15:09,083
Mm-hmm.

1566
01:15:09,125 --> 01:15:10,375
Have you had Manny's?

1567
01:15:11,166 --> 01:15:12,036
Oh, you'll love it.

1568
01:15:12,125 --> 01:15:14,745
Just really yummy sandwiches and salads.

1569
01:15:14,833 --> 01:15:16,333
I'll have the BLT.

1570
01:15:16,416 --> 01:15:17,416
Dad?

1571
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:19,000
Turkey.

1572
01:15:19,166 --> 01:15:20,496
I'll have the BLT.

1573
01:15:20,875 --> 01:15:22,575
- You'll have the kale?
- Kale salad.

1574
01:15:31,833 --> 01:15:32,833
Uh...

1575
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:41,630
I don't know, sorry.

1576
01:15:43,791 --> 01:15:45,291
Charlie will have, um...

1577
01:15:47,208 --> 01:15:48,208
the Greek salad,

1578
01:15:48,625 --> 01:15:51,375
but with lemon and olive oil
instead of the Greek dressing.

1579
01:15:51,458 --> 01:15:52,288
Okay.

1580
01:15:52,375 --> 01:15:54,785
- I'll have the Chinese chicken salad.
- Okay, sure.

1581
01:15:54,875 --> 01:15:55,875
Thank you.

1582
01:15:59,416 --> 01:16:02,416
Congratulations, Charlie, on your grant.
Nicole told me.

1583
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:03,540
Oh, thank you.

1584
01:16:03,625 --> 01:16:04,955
He's a genius.

1585
01:16:06,291 --> 01:16:09,081
Well, I told Nicole
I loved your play.

1586
01:16:09,166 --> 01:16:10,876
- Ah. Really.
- Oh, thanks.

1587
01:16:11,250 --> 01:16:13,170
You are one smart cookie.

1588
01:16:14,208 --> 01:16:15,378
Oh, thanks.

1589
01:16:15,458 --> 01:16:17,708
I would just love to...

1590
01:16:17,791 --> 01:16:20,131
crawl inside that brain.

1591
01:16:20,541 --> 01:16:24,831
There was that one moment
when you smell the toast, smell.

1592
01:16:25,833 --> 01:16:28,713
It was literally my favorite thing
that I saw that year.

1593
01:16:28,791 --> 01:16:31,251
- Thanks.
- Truly genius.

1594
01:16:31,333 --> 01:16:32,333
Thank you.

1595
01:16:32,833 --> 01:16:35,083
I was sorry to hear it closed on Broadway.

1596
01:16:35,458 --> 01:16:36,958
They couldn't smell the toast.

1597
01:16:38,333 --> 01:16:39,963
It was so emotional.

1598
01:16:41,250 --> 01:16:43,460
It's very competitive, I imagine.

1599
01:16:44,916 --> 01:16:48,416
Now, when Charlie is in Los Angeles,

1600
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:51,790
Nicole, of course, agrees
that it will be best for Henry

1601
01:16:52,250 --> 01:16:54,580
that he see each parent equally.

1602
01:16:56,375 --> 01:17:00,165
It's very nice out here, Charlie.
You should give it a chance.

1603
01:17:00,250 --> 01:17:02,710
- Yeah, and the space... you can't beat it.
- Mmm.

1604
01:17:02,791 --> 01:17:03,831
I love it too.

1605
01:17:04,666 --> 01:17:07,956
But all of our personal feelings
about the two cities aside,

1606
01:17:08,041 --> 01:17:12,251
we don't share your assertion
that the couple is an LA-based family.

1607
01:17:12,333 --> 01:17:14,633
It was very clearly their deal

1608
01:17:14,708 --> 01:17:17,998
that they would go back to New York
after Nicole finished her show.

1609
01:17:18,083 --> 01:17:19,633
I'm not aware of any deal.

1610
01:17:20,416 --> 01:17:22,126
Well, I didn't get it in writing.

1611
01:17:25,041 --> 01:17:28,041
Charlie, is this like the deal
that you made

1612
01:17:28,125 --> 01:17:31,575
that you Nicole would spend more time
in LA during your marriage?

1613
01:17:31,666 --> 01:17:34,496
We didn't have a deal.
It was something we discussed.

1614
01:17:34,583 --> 01:17:35,673
But...

1615
01:17:35,750 --> 01:17:38,630
So, it's a deal
when it's something you want

1616
01:17:38,708 --> 01:17:40,828
and a discussion when Nicole wants it?

1617
01:17:44,125 --> 01:17:45,125
Sidebar...

1618
01:17:46,083 --> 01:17:49,003
Nora, do you have a spare office
where Charlie and I can sidebar?

1619
01:17:49,083 --> 01:17:49,923
Sure.

1620
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,920
- Can you, um...
- I can show you.

1621
01:17:52,458 --> 01:17:53,458
Come on.

1622
01:17:59,291 --> 01:18:02,211
- Nora is a very good lawyer.
- Uh-huh.

1623
01:18:03,375 --> 01:18:04,705
- Tough, right?
- Yeah.

1624
01:18:05,291 --> 01:18:08,171
And you're in a bind because you've shown
you're willing to fly out here

1625
01:18:08,250 --> 01:18:10,040
and rent an apartment to see your son.

1626
01:18:10,125 --> 01:18:11,825
- You told me to do that.
- I know that.

1627
01:18:11,916 --> 01:18:15,166
And I'm doing that because I want
to see my kid, not to set a precedent.

1628
01:18:15,250 --> 01:18:17,830
Yes, but unfortunately,
you are setting a precedent.

1629
01:18:18,625 --> 01:18:20,245
And a judge might look at it that way.

1630
01:18:20,333 --> 01:18:23,543
What's the alternative? I stay in New York
and never come out here?

1631
01:18:23,625 --> 01:18:25,625
No, because then it would look
to the court

1632
01:18:25,708 --> 01:18:27,578
like you don't care about seeing your son.

1633
01:18:27,666 --> 01:18:30,826
Court or no court? Stop saying "court"
and then "never court."

1634
01:18:30,916 --> 01:18:33,666
Well, the way this is going,
we may have to go to court.

1635
01:18:34,291 --> 01:18:36,961
- Are you aware of how maddening you sound?
- I am.

1636
01:18:38,291 --> 01:18:40,081
And I know it seems unfair.

1637
01:18:43,791 --> 01:18:45,131
But imagine if you were...

1638
01:18:46,166 --> 01:18:49,076
a poor mother whose husband abandons her,

1639
01:18:49,166 --> 01:18:50,916
and then refuses to pay anything.

1640
01:18:52,666 --> 01:18:55,416
That's what the system
is trying to protect people from.

1641
01:18:57,666 --> 01:18:58,666
Listen...

1642
01:18:59,416 --> 01:19:00,786
if I were representing you...

1643
01:19:00,875 --> 01:19:02,035
You are representing me.

1644
01:19:02,125 --> 01:19:03,625
Right, no, of course. No...

1645
01:19:04,416 --> 01:19:08,326
I don't see a judge
moving this child from California.

1646
01:19:08,416 --> 01:19:10,206
I think we try and settle today.

1647
01:19:10,625 --> 01:19:12,575
Settle meaning what?

1648
01:19:13,375 --> 01:19:14,375
She gets LA.

1649
01:19:14,416 --> 01:19:15,826
No, Bert, just...

1650
01:19:16,875 --> 01:19:17,875
No.

1651
01:19:18,125 --> 01:19:19,705
I mean, we have to win this.

1652
01:19:20,083 --> 01:19:22,793
Remember, the win
is what's best for Henry.

1653
01:19:22,875 --> 01:19:25,315
And if you guys go to court,
he's going to get pulled into it.

1654
01:19:25,375 --> 01:19:28,415
But if he stays here
and I stay in New York, that's just...

1655
01:19:28,791 --> 01:19:29,791
then I won't...

1656
01:19:30,541 --> 01:19:32,541
I'll never get to really be
his parent again.

1657
01:19:32,625 --> 01:19:33,455
It'll be different.

1658
01:19:33,541 --> 01:19:34,581
It won't exist.

1659
01:19:35,041 --> 01:19:36,541
So maybe you move here.

1660
01:19:37,166 --> 01:19:38,746
You heard what Aamir said about space.

1661
01:19:38,833 --> 01:19:41,463
Fuck the space, Bert! Fuck the space!

1662
01:19:41,541 --> 01:19:44,921
I'll do whatever you want me to do,
but this is my advice.

1663
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,040
I've seen these things go on and on,

1664
01:19:47,333 --> 01:19:50,173
and the burden of these battles
is immeasurable.

1665
01:19:50,250 --> 01:19:54,290
I had a client get colon cancer and die
before he and his wife came to agreement.

1666
01:19:54,375 --> 01:19:55,825
What about filing in New York?

1667
01:19:55,916 --> 01:19:56,996
It's too late.

1668
01:19:57,333 --> 01:19:59,333
And even if you did,
I don't think it would matter.

1669
01:19:59,375 --> 01:20:01,215
They're being reasonable financially,
you know?

1670
01:20:01,291 --> 01:20:03,921
You're... You're lucky they didn't ask
for half your grant money.

1671
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,809
She wouldn't do that. She knows
I put all that money back in my theater.

1672
01:20:06,833 --> 01:20:08,423
If this continues, she might.

1673
01:20:08,875 --> 01:20:11,125
The actors and crew
all rely on that money.

1674
01:20:11,208 --> 01:20:13,168
The court would never agree
with this, right?

1675
01:20:13,250 --> 01:20:16,170
Whether they do or not,
it'll cost you half your grant money

1676
01:20:16,250 --> 01:20:17,670
to go to court and prove it.

1677
01:20:20,583 --> 01:20:21,753
I feel like a criminal.

1678
01:20:22,708 --> 01:20:24,328
But you didn't commit any crime.

1679
01:20:24,416 --> 01:20:25,746
It doesn't feel that way.

1680
01:20:25,833 --> 01:20:28,083
If we give on LA right now,

1681
01:20:28,333 --> 01:20:30,173
and then try to make
the best deal possible,

1682
01:20:30,250 --> 01:20:32,290
I think we can get her
to give on other fronts.

1683
01:20:32,375 --> 01:20:34,285
There are no other fronts!

1684
01:20:35,250 --> 01:20:36,420
This is the thing!

1685
01:20:37,166 --> 01:20:39,206
He needs to know that I fought for him!

1686
01:20:39,291 --> 01:20:40,291
He'll know.

1687
01:20:54,791 --> 01:20:57,517
I should never have
let her come out here with Henry.

1688
01:20:57,541 --> 01:20:59,921
If it wasn't LA and New York,
it'd be something else.

1689
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:03,420
You'd be fighting about a house,
or a school district, or...

1690
01:21:04,833 --> 01:21:05,963
You know what this is like?

1691
01:21:06,041 --> 01:21:10,041
This is like that joke about the woman
at the hairdresser, she's going to Rome.

1692
01:21:10,125 --> 01:21:11,995
- Do you know this?
- I don't.

1693
01:21:12,083 --> 01:21:14,003
This woman is at her hairdresser
and she says,

1694
01:21:14,083 --> 01:21:15,463
"I'm going to Rome on holiday."

1695
01:21:15,541 --> 01:21:18,041
And he says, "Oh, really?
What... what airline are you taking?"

1696
01:21:18,125 --> 01:21:19,535
She says, "Alitalia."

1697
01:21:19,750 --> 01:21:21,880
He says, "Alitalia? Are you crazy?

1698
01:21:21,958 --> 01:21:24,208
That's the worst...
That's terrible. Don't take that."

1699
01:21:24,291 --> 01:21:25,851
He says, "Where are you going to stay?"

1700
01:21:25,916 --> 01:21:27,676
She says, "I'm going to stay
at the Hassler."

1701
01:21:27,708 --> 01:21:29,788
"The Hassler? What, are you kidding?

1702
01:21:29,875 --> 01:21:32,785
They're renovating the Hassler.
You'll hear hammering all night long.

1703
01:21:32,875 --> 01:21:34,825
You won't sleep.
What are you going to see?"

1704
01:21:34,916 --> 01:21:37,326
She says, "I think I'm going to try
to go to the Vatican."

1705
01:21:37,416 --> 01:21:39,826
"The Vatican?
You'll be standing in line all day long.

1706
01:21:39,916 --> 01:21:41,351
You'll never get to see anything..."

1707
01:21:41,375 --> 01:21:43,575
I'm sorry, Bert,
am I paying for this joke?

1708
01:21:45,791 --> 01:21:48,171
Whatever happens here, it's temporary.

1709
01:21:48,916 --> 01:21:51,916
He's growing up. He's going to have
opinions on the subject.

1710
01:21:52,375 --> 01:21:54,245
Time is on your side, Charlie.

1711
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,170
Maybe he'll do college on the East Coast.

1712
01:22:06,833 --> 01:22:11,173
I have most of my coins,
like my quarters and dimes at Daddy's...

1713
01:22:11,250 --> 01:22:13,210
- Right.
- ...but I'm keeping my dollars

1714
01:22:13,291 --> 01:22:15,421
and my one twenty at yours, okay?

1715
01:22:15,875 --> 01:22:20,075
So, that is one twenty plus 50,
what is that?

1716
01:22:20,416 --> 01:22:21,496
Goddamn it.

1717
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:23,000
What's "Goddamn it"?

1718
01:22:23,083 --> 01:22:24,963
Did you guys lose power where you are?

1719
01:22:25,041 --> 01:22:27,171
Dad? Did we lose power?

1720
01:22:27,666 --> 01:22:28,666
No.

1721
01:22:29,125 --> 01:22:31,995
There's rolling blackouts
in the hills and now...

1722
01:22:32,583 --> 01:22:35,043
Oh, damn it.
Now the gate won't close.

1723
01:22:35,125 --> 01:22:36,625
Her gate won't close.

1724
01:22:42,166 --> 01:22:43,166
Mom!

1725
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:44,330
Hey.

1726
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,267
- Can we go see my room?
- Yeah, of course.

1727
01:22:49,291 --> 01:22:51,011
- You tried all the...
- I tried everything.

1728
01:22:51,041 --> 01:22:52,751
Sorry I made you come out.

1729
01:22:52,833 --> 01:22:53,673
It's fine.

1730
01:22:53,791 --> 01:22:55,791
- I just...
- You don't want your gate open.

1731
01:22:55,958 --> 01:22:56,958
Right.

1732
01:22:57,208 --> 01:23:00,668
- There should be a panel or something...
- Maybe this is something here.

1733
01:23:02,833 --> 01:23:04,213
- It's a cute house.
- Oh, yeah.

1734
01:23:04,291 --> 01:23:06,001
I mean, from what I can see.

1735
01:23:06,083 --> 01:23:07,083
Thanks.

1736
01:23:10,875 --> 01:23:11,995
You're getting shaggy.

1737
01:23:12,083 --> 01:23:14,673
Yeah, I have to find a hair cutter.

1738
01:23:16,250 --> 01:23:17,380
You want me to cut it?

1739
01:23:18,291 --> 01:23:19,291
Okay.

1740
01:23:30,166 --> 01:23:31,206
Close your eyes.

1741
01:23:36,291 --> 01:23:37,291
He's out.

1742
01:23:37,625 --> 01:23:39,285
Maybe he should stay here tonight.

1743
01:23:40,583 --> 01:23:41,583
It's my night.

1744
01:24:10,625 --> 01:24:13,285
Hey, come on. We're going.
Come on. Let's take a walk. Right?

1745
01:24:13,375 --> 01:24:14,695
Yeah, we're going to take a walk.

1746
01:24:14,750 --> 01:24:16,809
- We're taking a walk.
- Fine, all right. She's crazy.

1747
01:24:16,833 --> 01:24:18,213
We're mostly finished.

1748
01:24:18,833 --> 01:24:21,383
Bert and I hammered out
90 percent of the details,

1749
01:24:21,458 --> 01:24:24,578
and there's a couple minor things hanging,

1750
01:24:24,666 --> 01:24:25,786
but it should be easy.

1751
01:24:26,750 --> 01:24:29,080
And then the judge
makes your divorce official.

1752
01:24:29,958 --> 01:24:31,038
Oh. That's good.

1753
01:24:33,875 --> 01:24:35,825
- Fuck me.
- What?

1754
01:24:35,916 --> 01:24:37,786
Who's that?

1755
01:24:37,875 --> 01:24:40,625
Oh, Charlie shouldn't have done this.

1756
01:24:40,708 --> 01:24:42,288
What do you mean? Where's Bert?

1757
01:24:42,375 --> 01:24:45,995
This means that everything
we've agreed upon now is off the table.

1758
01:24:46,416 --> 01:24:47,496
We've got LA, right?

1759
01:24:47,583 --> 01:24:49,633
Not with Jay Marotta representing him.

1760
01:24:50,208 --> 01:24:51,668
This is a street fight now.

1761
01:24:51,750 --> 01:24:55,290
And I'm going to have to ask for things
that we wouldn't normally ask for.

1762
01:24:55,875 --> 01:24:58,375
This system rewards bad behavior.

1763
01:24:59,833 --> 01:25:01,003
- Jay.
- Hey.

1764
01:25:01,083 --> 01:25:02,083
Hi.

1765
01:25:02,208 --> 01:25:04,418
I saw Miriam at Madeo the other night.

1766
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:05,960
- Yeah?
- Looking very handsome.

1767
01:25:06,041 --> 01:25:09,041
Oh, you know, you should come
to our Stand Up To Cancer event.

1768
01:25:09,125 --> 01:25:11,365
- Uh, John Legend's going to play.
- Oh, love him.

1769
01:25:11,416 --> 01:25:13,517
Okay? It's going to be
at the Beverly Hilton, I think.

1770
01:25:13,541 --> 01:25:14,601
- Great.
- Okay?

1771
01:25:14,625 --> 01:25:16,385
She said you're spending
more time in Malibu.

1772
01:25:16,416 --> 01:25:17,956
- Oh, really?
- Me too.

1773
01:25:18,041 --> 01:25:20,001
I haven't seen her
since that building was ICM.

1774
01:25:21,041 --> 01:25:22,251
A little history...

1775
01:25:23,833 --> 01:25:26,083
Ten years ago, Charlie takes a risk

1776
01:25:26,166 --> 01:25:30,786
when he first hires Nicole as an actress
in his play in New York City.

1777
01:25:31,500 --> 01:25:34,040
He's a well-regarded
up-and-coming director

1778
01:25:34,125 --> 01:25:35,575
of the avant-garde.

1779
01:25:35,875 --> 01:25:39,075
And she's known
as the girl in that college sex movie

1780
01:25:39,166 --> 01:25:41,166
who takes her top off.

1781
01:25:41,333 --> 01:25:43,434
- My client will not be slut-shamed...
- Ten years on...

1782
01:25:43,458 --> 01:25:44,628
...for an artistic choice.

1783
01:25:44,708 --> 01:25:47,078
...and many prestigious
theater roles later...

1784
01:25:47,583 --> 01:25:50,173
she becomes an actress
of great credibility.

1785
01:25:50,250 --> 01:25:52,500
And it's because of that credibility,

1786
01:25:52,791 --> 01:25:56,631
that she's offered the lead role
in a major television show.

1787
01:25:56,708 --> 01:26:00,128
This new opportunity is thanks to Charlie.

1788
01:26:00,208 --> 01:26:04,168
Your Honor, we shouldn't have to pay
support money at this point.

1789
01:26:05,083 --> 01:26:08,833
In fact, Charlie is entitled
to half her TV money,

1790
01:26:09,375 --> 01:26:11,915
present and future earnings of the show.

1791
01:26:14,500 --> 01:26:18,540
Charlie's just received
the enormous sum of $650,000

1792
01:26:18,625 --> 01:26:20,075
in the form of a MacArthur grant.

1793
01:26:20,166 --> 01:26:22,226
- Of which he gets...
- This is for the theater work...

1794
01:26:22,250 --> 01:26:24,920
- ...he conducted during the marriage.
- ...in 125,000 installments

1795
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:26,250
...over five years.

1796
01:26:26,333 --> 01:26:28,767
- So by Jay's same logic, this is work...
- He uses the money...

1797
01:26:28,791 --> 01:26:31,476
- ...that Nicole contributed to.
- to employ actors and crew members...

1798
01:26:31,500 --> 01:26:34,059
- One at a time, please.
- ...and to pay debts that he's accumulated

1799
01:26:34,083 --> 01:26:36,963
with his theater company
that stars his wife.

1800
01:26:39,791 --> 01:26:42,081
- Bless you.
- Not only did she turn down

1801
01:26:42,166 --> 01:26:44,126
a lucrative and successful career
in movies

1802
01:26:44,208 --> 01:26:46,498
to perform in his little theater,

1803
01:26:47,083 --> 01:26:51,083
but she actually supplied Charlie
with a loan early on to help out.

1804
01:26:51,166 --> 01:26:53,666
- Which he paid back.
- She lent her name to the marquee,

1805
01:26:53,750 --> 01:26:56,017
which was the principle reason
people came to the theater.

1806
01:26:56,041 --> 01:26:57,791
That may have been true ten years ago.

1807
01:26:57,875 --> 01:27:02,035
And in turn,
she helped establish Charlie's reputation.

1808
01:27:02,541 --> 01:27:04,081
Now, over the next ten years,

1809
01:27:04,166 --> 01:27:07,246
she was subsequently offered parts
in movies, TV shows,

1810
01:27:07,375 --> 01:27:09,705
most of which she turned down
at Charlie's behest

1811
01:27:09,791 --> 01:27:12,461
to be a mom and act in his plays.

1812
01:27:13,041 --> 01:27:17,041
So, while we are willing to be flexible
on support,

1813
01:27:17,125 --> 01:27:20,825
we contend that half of Charlie's
grant money be split between the parties.

1814
01:27:20,916 --> 01:27:23,376
I don't see how you can claim
that she gets half a grant

1815
01:27:23,458 --> 01:27:25,418
dedicated to his genius.

1816
01:27:25,500 --> 01:27:27,059
He became a genius during the marriage.

1817
01:27:27,083 --> 01:27:28,003
Oh, come on, Nora.

1818
01:27:28,083 --> 01:27:30,833
Charlie himself, upon hearing
that he received the prize,

1819
01:27:30,916 --> 01:27:33,206
told Nicole that it belonged to her too.

1820
01:27:33,583 --> 01:27:35,713
That's what people say
when they win awards.

1821
01:27:35,791 --> 01:27:38,751
Mmm. No, he was implying what was true.

1822
01:27:39,458 --> 01:27:42,918
His genius was an intangible asset
built during the marriage.

1823
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:46,040
Nora, I like how you refer
to Charlie's theater

1824
01:27:46,125 --> 01:27:48,705
as a ramshackle downtown dump

1825
01:27:48,791 --> 01:27:50,291
when you're arguing custody,

1826
01:27:50,375 --> 01:27:52,325
but when you want more money,

1827
01:27:52,583 --> 01:27:55,083
he's a big, rich, genius
Broadway director.

1828
01:27:55,166 --> 01:27:56,456
You can't have it both ways.

1829
01:27:56,541 --> 01:27:57,541
Oh, really? Why not?

1830
01:27:58,041 --> 01:28:00,251
And whether you think
it's fair or not, Jay,

1831
01:28:00,958 --> 01:28:03,378
the first monetary installment
from the MacArthur grant

1832
01:28:03,458 --> 01:28:06,267
was put into a joint marital account,
and thus became communal property.

1833
01:28:06,291 --> 01:28:08,921
Fuck. You shouldn't have put
that money in a joint account.

1834
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:12,059
There's not going to be anything left,
anyway. I'm using it all to divorce her.

1835
01:28:12,083 --> 01:28:14,673
Nora, I have to say
that your account of this marriage

1836
01:28:14,750 --> 01:28:17,330
takes place in an alternate reality.

1837
01:28:17,916 --> 01:28:23,376
By suddenly moving to LA
and insisting on an LA residence,

1838
01:28:23,458 --> 01:28:25,578
Nicole is withholding Henry...

1839
01:28:25,666 --> 01:28:28,476
- Counsel, please be seated.
- ...alienating him from his father,

1840
01:28:28,500 --> 01:28:31,460
which has turned Charlie's world
upside down.

1841
01:28:31,541 --> 01:28:33,309
- Counselor?
- It amounts to an ambush.

1842
01:28:33,333 --> 01:28:35,503
"Witholding," Jay? Really? "Alienating"?

1843
01:28:35,916 --> 01:28:37,206
Well, those are fighting words,

1844
01:28:37,291 --> 01:28:40,331
and it's simply false and does nothing
to further this settlement.

1845
01:28:41,500 --> 01:28:44,380
Your recap of this situation
is outrageous.

1846
01:28:44,458 --> 01:28:47,458
And although California is,
without doubt, a no-fault state,

1847
01:28:47,541 --> 01:28:50,711
it bears mentioning
in the accurate recap of this situation

1848
01:28:50,791 --> 01:28:52,711
that Charlie had had extramarital affairs.

1849
01:28:52,791 --> 01:28:55,381
- An extramarital affair.
- Do you really want me to go there?

1850
01:28:55,458 --> 01:28:57,418
- Yeah, let's go there.
- Okay.

1851
01:28:57,583 --> 01:29:00,583
Nicole has admitted
to hacking Charlie's computer

1852
01:29:00,666 --> 01:29:02,076
and reading his emails,

1853
01:29:02,166 --> 01:29:04,576
which, if proven, is a felony.

1854
01:29:04,916 --> 01:29:06,706
And, Nora,
I don't think you'd be too happy

1855
01:29:06,791 --> 01:29:10,171
if I ask Nicole about her alcohol
consumption in the evenings.

1856
01:29:10,250 --> 01:29:11,080
What?

1857
01:29:11,166 --> 01:29:13,746
She confided in Charlie
one night recently,

1858
01:29:13,833 --> 01:29:16,213
having just carried Henry to bed,

1859
01:29:16,291 --> 01:29:20,631
that she was having trouble standing
while walking down the staircase.

1860
01:29:21,291 --> 01:29:24,251
And from what I understand,
this is not an isolated event.

1861
01:29:24,333 --> 01:29:26,503
So you let me know, Nora,

1862
01:29:26,583 --> 01:29:28,923
- and we will go there as needed.
- Charlie?

1863
01:29:29,958 --> 01:29:30,958
Can I ask you,

1864
01:29:31,041 --> 01:29:33,041
how do you expect
to have more time with Henry

1865
01:29:33,125 --> 01:29:35,575
when you don't exercise the time
you already have,

1866
01:29:35,666 --> 01:29:37,956
and exercise it responsibly?

1867
01:29:38,500 --> 01:29:41,210
On a recent visit to Los Angeles,

1868
01:29:41,291 --> 01:29:43,921
after failing to call, text,

1869
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,210
communicate in any way, shape, or form,

1870
01:29:46,458 --> 01:29:47,978
Charlie finally arrived two hours late

1871
01:29:48,041 --> 01:29:49,961
to pick up Henry
at Nicole's mother's house.

1872
01:29:50,041 --> 01:29:51,961
At that point, the car seat,

1873
01:29:52,041 --> 01:29:55,791
which he had assured Nicole
had been professionally installed,

1874
01:29:55,875 --> 01:29:57,285
was clearly not even belted in.

1875
01:29:57,375 --> 01:30:00,309
- It was just sitting in the back seat.
- You have to buckle in the car seat.

1876
01:30:00,333 --> 01:30:01,213
- It's the law.
- I know.

1877
01:30:01,291 --> 01:30:03,892
- I thought the rental place did it.
- They can't. It's a liability.

1878
01:30:03,916 --> 01:30:06,017
I know that now.
Once we discovered that, we fixed it.

1879
01:30:06,041 --> 01:30:07,041
Counsel?

1880
01:30:07,958 --> 01:30:09,498
You can see my courtroom is full

1881
01:30:09,583 --> 01:30:13,133
and there are people who don't have
the resources your clients have,

1882
01:30:13,541 --> 01:30:16,751
and I'm fairly certain
you haven't exhausted, in good faith,

1883
01:30:16,833 --> 01:30:19,133
the arguments in the case of this child.

1884
01:30:19,208 --> 01:30:21,748
In the meantime,
we'll keep the status quo.

1885
01:30:21,833 --> 01:30:25,423
This remains an LA family
for the time being.

1886
01:30:25,708 --> 01:30:27,998
I took over this department recently,

1887
01:30:28,583 --> 01:30:31,213
and I'm still becoming acquainted
with the cases.

1888
01:30:31,291 --> 01:30:35,291
So, I'm going to appoint
an expert evaluator

1889
01:30:35,750 --> 01:30:38,710
who knows much more about young children
than I do.

1890
01:30:39,375 --> 01:30:41,495
Once the evaluation is done,

1891
01:30:41,708 --> 01:30:44,458
we'll modify the orders where necessary.

1892
01:30:49,541 --> 01:30:50,581
Hey.

1893
01:30:51,250 --> 01:30:52,380
Hey, where's Henry?

1894
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,130
He's with Cassie and her kids
at laser tag.

1895
01:30:56,250 --> 01:30:57,370
You want something to drink?

1896
01:30:57,416 --> 01:31:01,076
I have unfiltered tap water, beer,
and some juice boxes.

1897
01:31:01,416 --> 01:31:02,536
I'll take a juice box.

1898
01:31:08,708 --> 01:31:10,708
You don't have anything on the walls?

1899
01:31:10,791 --> 01:31:13,911
I don't have anything to put on them
except Henry's art, which is being framed.

1900
01:31:13,958 --> 01:31:17,708
I can give you some stuff,
you know, until you get some things.

1901
01:31:18,250 --> 01:31:21,460
How about that great picture of Henry
on the Staten Island Ferry?

1902
01:31:21,625 --> 01:31:22,785
Aren't you in that one?

1903
01:31:24,291 --> 01:31:25,631
I guess I... You could...

1904
01:31:25,708 --> 01:31:27,309
- cut me out.
- I have to leave a day early

1905
01:31:27,333 --> 01:31:28,543
to New York on the 22nd.

1906
01:31:28,625 --> 01:31:30,705
So I was wondering
if I could take Henry that Friday.

1907
01:31:30,750 --> 01:31:33,830
Uh, the 22nd. So, that's the 21st?

1908
01:31:34,416 --> 01:31:36,326
Mmm, we have plans, actually.

1909
01:31:36,416 --> 01:31:39,456
We're going to, um, some thing at LACMA
with the cousins.

1910
01:31:40,041 --> 01:31:42,131
But could you change it
so I could take him?

1911
01:31:42,208 --> 01:31:43,878
Mmm. It's just one night.

1912
01:31:43,958 --> 01:31:45,498
- He's looking forward to it.
- Really?

1913
01:31:46,250 --> 01:31:48,330
It's my night, Charlie, we negotiated it.

1914
01:31:48,625 --> 01:31:49,625
Okay, fine.

1915
01:31:50,708 --> 01:31:51,708
But what?

1916
01:31:51,750 --> 01:31:53,710
No, I'm just asking you to be flexible.

1917
01:31:53,791 --> 01:31:56,631
I am flexible. You come in and out
and I adjust based on your schedule.

1918
01:31:56,708 --> 01:31:59,868
- This one night we have tickets to...
- It's not only this one night, but fine.

1919
01:32:00,125 --> 01:32:03,325
- Henry's teacher wants to meet with us.
- You mean his LA teacher?

1920
01:32:03,416 --> 01:32:06,376
Can you, uh, answer the email
so we could set a time?

1921
01:32:06,750 --> 01:32:08,210
Yeah, I've been distracted.

1922
01:32:09,333 --> 01:32:10,463
I understand.

1923
01:32:10,875 --> 01:32:13,475
They just want to rule out everything,
you know, with his reading.

1924
01:32:13,500 --> 01:32:15,500
I just think
he's a little over-anxious.

1925
01:32:15,583 --> 01:32:17,003
I think he wants it too much.

1926
01:32:17,083 --> 01:32:19,003
They said he's off the charts in math.

1927
01:32:19,083 --> 01:32:21,476
He quits too easily
when things aren't easy for him.

1928
01:32:21,500 --> 01:32:23,170
You know, he's like us, he's stubborn.

1929
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:27,250
He's still a lousy Monopoly player
because he tries to save all his money.

1930
01:32:32,708 --> 01:32:33,708
So...

1931
01:32:34,833 --> 01:32:37,463
- I thought we should talk.
- Mm-hmm.

1932
01:32:37,541 --> 01:32:39,581
I feel like maybe things
have gone too far.

1933
01:32:39,625 --> 01:32:40,455
Uh-huh.

1934
01:32:40,541 --> 01:32:43,791
I mean, my mom's taking out a loan
against the house to help me pay Nora.

1935
01:32:43,875 --> 01:32:45,165
I thought I paid Nora.

1936
01:32:45,250 --> 01:32:46,960
You pay 30 percent of Nora.

1937
01:32:47,041 --> 01:32:49,541
Well, I'm going broke too,
if that's any help.

1938
01:32:49,791 --> 01:32:51,791
I've just agreed to direct
two shitty plays,

1939
01:32:51,875 --> 01:32:54,235
and we can forget putting anything away
for Henry's college.

1940
01:32:54,750 --> 01:32:58,040
It's just that up until now, we've been
able to keep Henry somewhat removed,

1941
01:32:58,125 --> 01:32:59,455
and this will change that.

1942
01:32:59,625 --> 01:33:00,625
Mm-hmm.

1943
01:33:00,916 --> 01:33:01,916
We have to protect him.

1944
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:02,830
I agree.

1945
01:33:02,916 --> 01:33:06,166
Nora says that the evaluator
will come into our homes,

1946
01:33:06,458 --> 01:33:08,958
they're going to interview Henry
in addition to us,

1947
01:33:09,041 --> 01:33:12,131
our friends, family, enemies,

1948
01:33:12,208 --> 01:33:15,498
and then they'll observe us with him,
how we are as parents.

1949
01:33:15,583 --> 01:33:17,173
- Sounds awful.
- I know.

1950
01:33:17,583 --> 01:33:21,423
I feel like if anybody observed me on any
given day as a mom, I'd never get custody.

1951
01:33:23,583 --> 01:33:24,583
That was a joke.

1952
01:33:25,041 --> 01:33:27,291
- I know. I feel the same way.
- Right.

1953
01:33:27,375 --> 01:33:28,375
So...

1954
01:33:29,666 --> 01:33:31,916
Maybe we can figure
something out between us.

1955
01:33:32,375 --> 01:33:34,455
You remember I said this to you
at the beginning?

1956
01:33:34,541 --> 01:33:36,831
I know you did,
but these are different circumstances.

1957
01:33:36,916 --> 01:33:38,746
I was anticipating these circumstances.

1958
01:33:39,583 --> 01:33:41,543
Anyway, shall we try this?

1959
01:33:41,625 --> 01:33:42,625
Okay.

1960
01:33:57,125 --> 01:33:58,165
I don't know how to start.

1961
01:34:00,666 --> 01:34:03,036
Do you understand
why I want to stay in LA?

1962
01:34:03,125 --> 01:34:03,955
No.

1963
01:34:04,041 --> 01:34:05,421
Well... That's not...

1964
01:34:05,500 --> 01:34:08,080
Charlie, that's not a useful way
for us to start.

1965
01:34:08,166 --> 01:34:09,286
I don't understand it.

1966
01:34:11,208 --> 01:34:13,998
You don't remember promising
that we could do time here?

1967
01:34:14,083 --> 01:34:15,083
We discussed things.

1968
01:34:15,541 --> 01:34:17,001
We were married, we said things.

1969
01:34:17,083 --> 01:34:18,753
We talked about moving to Europe.

1970
01:34:18,833 --> 01:34:20,043
About getting a...

1971
01:34:21,125 --> 01:34:23,245
sideboard, or what do you call it?

1972
01:34:23,333 --> 01:34:25,963
A credenza, to fill the empty space
behind the couch.

1973
01:34:26,041 --> 01:34:27,171
We never did any of it.

1974
01:34:27,250 --> 01:34:28,960
You turned down the residency
at the Geffen

1975
01:34:29,041 --> 01:34:31,211
that would've brought us here
for a... a year.

1976
01:34:31,291 --> 01:34:32,541
It wasn't something I wanted.

1977
01:34:32,625 --> 01:34:35,455
We had a great theater company
and a great life where we were.

1978
01:34:35,541 --> 01:34:38,081
- You call that a great life?
- You know what I mean.

1979
01:34:38,166 --> 01:34:40,876
I don't mean we had a great marriage.
I mean, life in Brooklyn.

1980
01:34:41,750 --> 01:34:42,750
Professionally.

1981
01:34:43,166 --> 01:34:45,706
I don't know. Honestly, I never considered
anything different.

1982
01:34:45,791 --> 01:34:47,421
Well, that's the problem, isn't it?

1983
01:34:47,500 --> 01:34:50,580
I mean, I was your wife.
You should've considered my happiness too.

1984
01:34:50,666 --> 01:34:54,286
Come on, you were happy.
You've just decided you weren't now.

1985
01:34:55,583 --> 01:34:57,883
Okay. Okay.

1986
01:34:57,958 --> 01:34:59,038
Let's...

1987
01:34:59,500 --> 01:35:02,250
M-My work is here now, my family is here.

1988
01:35:02,333 --> 01:35:05,226
And I agreed to put Henry in school here
because your show went to series.

1989
01:35:05,250 --> 01:35:08,351
I did that knowing that when you were done
shooting, he'd come back to New York.

1990
01:35:08,375 --> 01:35:09,415
Honey, we never said that.

1991
01:35:09,458 --> 01:35:12,142
That may have been your assumption,
but we never expressly said that.

1992
01:35:12,166 --> 01:35:14,746
- We did say it.
- When did we say it?

1993
01:35:14,833 --> 01:35:16,713
I don't know when we said it,
but we said it.

1994
01:35:16,791 --> 01:35:18,684
- I thought...
- We said it that time on the phone!

1995
01:35:18,708 --> 01:35:20,248
Honey, let me finish. Sorry.

1996
01:35:20,333 --> 01:35:21,633
I keep saying that.

1997
01:35:21,708 --> 01:35:24,578
I thought that if Henry was happy here,

1998
01:35:24,666 --> 01:35:27,496
and my show continued,
that we might do LA for a while.

1999
01:35:27,583 --> 01:35:29,793
I was not privy to that thought process.

2000
01:35:29,875 --> 01:35:31,595
The only reason
we didn't live here

2001
01:35:31,625 --> 01:35:33,285
is because you can't imagine desires

2002
01:35:33,375 --> 01:35:35,825
other than your own,
unless they're forced on you.

2003
01:35:35,916 --> 01:35:38,836
Okay, you wish you hadn't married me,
you wish you'd had a different life,

2004
01:35:38,916 --> 01:35:40,246
but this is what happened.

2005
01:35:41,416 --> 01:35:42,876
- So, what do we do?
- I don't know.

2006
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:46,920
Nora says
there's no coming back from this.

2007
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:50,540
Fuck Nora! I hate fucking Nora
telling me I always lived in LA

2008
01:35:50,625 --> 01:35:52,325
even though I never lived in LA.

2009
01:35:53,291 --> 01:35:55,251
How could you have her
say those things about me?

2010
01:35:55,333 --> 01:35:57,003
Jay said them about me too.

2011
01:35:57,541 --> 01:35:58,961
You shouldn't have fired Bert.

2012
01:35:59,041 --> 01:36:00,251
I needed my own asshole.

2013
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:05,920
Let's just both agree both of our lawyers
said shitty stuff about both of us.

2014
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:07,130
Nora was worse.

2015
01:36:07,500 --> 01:36:08,790
Jay called me an alcoholic.

2016
01:36:08,875 --> 01:36:11,684
You pulled the rug out from under me
and you're putting me through hell.

2017
01:36:11,708 --> 01:36:13,428
You put me through hell
during our marriage.

2018
01:36:13,500 --> 01:36:14,780
Oh, is that what that was, hell?

2019
01:36:14,833 --> 01:36:17,226
And now you're going to put Henry
through this horrible thing

2020
01:36:17,250 --> 01:36:19,726
- so you can yet again get what you want!
- It's not what I want.

2021
01:36:19,750 --> 01:36:22,000
I mean, it's what I want,
but it's what was...

2022
01:36:22,375 --> 01:36:23,375
was...

2023
01:36:23,708 --> 01:36:24,878
what's best for him.

2024
01:36:24,958 --> 01:36:28,418
Oh, well, I was wondering when you'd
get around to Henry and what he wants.

2025
01:36:28,500 --> 01:36:29,420
Fuck off!

2026
01:36:29,500 --> 01:36:32,920
No, you fuck off!
If you'd listen to your son, or anyone,

2027
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:34,800
then he'd tell you
that he'd rather live here!

2028
01:36:34,833 --> 01:36:36,673
Stop putting your feelings about me
onto Henry.

2029
01:36:36,708 --> 01:36:38,208
He tells me he likes it better here.

2030
01:36:38,291 --> 01:36:40,517
He tells you because he knows
it's what you want to hear!

2031
01:36:40,541 --> 01:36:43,267
He tells me you're on the phone all
the time. You don't play with him.

2032
01:36:43,291 --> 01:36:46,476
Because I'm going through a divorce in LA
and trying to direct a play in New York!

2033
01:36:46,500 --> 01:36:49,540
Which closed because I wasn't there.
It was a huge opportunity for me...

2034
01:36:49,625 --> 01:36:51,585
You're fighting for something
you don't even want!

2035
01:36:51,625 --> 01:36:53,059
And I let everyone down.

2036
01:36:53,083 --> 01:36:55,133
You're being so much like your father.

2037
01:36:55,625 --> 01:36:57,035
Do not compare me to my father!

2038
01:36:57,125 --> 01:36:59,535
I didn't compare you to him.
I said you were acting like him.

2039
01:36:59,625 --> 01:37:00,905
You're exactly like your mother.

2040
01:37:00,958 --> 01:37:04,142
Everything you were complaining about her,
you're doing. You're suffocating Henry.

2041
01:37:04,166 --> 01:37:06,876
First of all, I love my mother.
She was a wonderful mother.

2042
01:37:06,958 --> 01:37:09,351
- I'm just repeating what you told me.
- Secondly, how dare you

2043
01:37:09,375 --> 01:37:11,205
compare my mothering to my mother!

2044
01:37:11,291 --> 01:37:14,251
I may be like my father,
but I am not like my mother!

2045
01:37:14,333 --> 01:37:15,333
You are!

2046
01:37:15,416 --> 01:37:16,956
And you're like my father!

2047
01:37:17,041 --> 01:37:18,461
You're also like my mother!

2048
01:37:18,541 --> 01:37:20,751
You're all the bad things
about all of these people!

2049
01:37:21,250 --> 01:37:22,330
But mostly your mother.

2050
01:37:22,416 --> 01:37:23,776
When we would lie in bed together,

2051
01:37:23,833 --> 01:37:26,673
sometimes I would look at you and see her
and just feel so gross!

2052
01:37:26,750 --> 01:37:29,460
- I felt repulsed when you touched me!
- You're a slob.

2053
01:37:29,541 --> 01:37:31,221
I made all the beds,
closed all cabinets...

2054
01:37:31,250 --> 01:37:34,540
The thought of having sex with you
makes me want to peel my skin off.

2055
01:37:34,625 --> 01:37:36,955
You'll never be happy, in LA or anywhere.

2056
01:37:37,041 --> 01:37:39,541
You'll think you found
some better opposite guy than me,

2057
01:37:39,625 --> 01:37:41,995
and in a few years,
you'll rebel against him

2058
01:37:42,083 --> 01:37:45,213
because you need to have your voice,
but you don't want a voice.

2059
01:37:45,291 --> 01:37:47,611
You just want to fucking complain
about not having a voice!

2060
01:37:47,666 --> 01:37:50,916
I think about being married to you,
and that woman is a stranger to me.

2061
01:37:51,458 --> 01:37:53,918
- I mean, we had a child's marriage.
- You've regressed.

2062
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,630
You've gone back to your life
before you met me, it's pathetic.

2063
01:37:56,708 --> 01:38:00,578
People used to tell me that you were
too selfish to be a great artist.

2064
01:38:00,666 --> 01:38:02,376
And I used to defend you.

2065
01:38:02,458 --> 01:38:03,828
They were absolutely right.

2066
01:38:03,916 --> 01:38:06,626
All your best acting is behind you.
You're back to being a hack!

2067
01:38:06,708 --> 01:38:09,878
You gaslighted me!
You're a fucking villain!

2068
01:38:09,958 --> 01:38:13,418
You want to present yourself as a victim
because it's a good legal strategy?

2069
01:38:13,500 --> 01:38:16,580
Fine, but you and I both know
you chose this life!

2070
01:38:17,125 --> 01:38:18,995
You wanted it until you didn't!

2071
01:38:20,041 --> 01:38:22,291
You used me so you could get out of LA.

2072
01:38:22,375 --> 01:38:23,415
I didn't use you.

2073
01:38:23,500 --> 01:38:25,830
You did, and then you blamed me for it!

2074
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,420
You always made me aware
of what I was doing wrong,

2075
01:38:28,500 --> 01:38:29,790
how I was falling short!

2076
01:38:29,875 --> 01:38:31,575
Life with you was joyless!

2077
01:38:31,666 --> 01:38:34,206
What, so then you had to go
and fuck someone else?

2078
01:38:34,291 --> 01:38:35,931
You shouldn't be upset that I fucked her!

2079
01:38:35,958 --> 01:38:37,838
You should be upset
that I had a laugh with her!

2080
01:38:37,916 --> 01:38:38,746
Do you love her?

2081
01:38:38,833 --> 01:38:40,083
No.

2082
01:38:40,166 --> 01:38:42,626
But she didn't hate me. You hated me.

2083
01:38:42,708 --> 01:38:43,788
You hated me.

2084
01:38:43,875 --> 01:38:45,575
You fucked somebody we worked with.

2085
01:38:45,666 --> 01:38:48,166
You stopped having sex with me
in the last year.

2086
01:38:48,250 --> 01:38:49,750
I never cheated on you.

2087
01:38:49,833 --> 01:38:50,923
That was cheating on me!

2088
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:52,960
But there was so much I could have done.

2089
01:38:53,041 --> 01:38:55,671
I was a director in my twenties
who came from nothing

2090
01:38:55,750 --> 01:38:58,920
and was suddenly on the cover
of fucking Time Out New York!

2091
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,960
I was hot shit and I wanted
to fuck everybody and I didn't.

2092
01:39:02,041 --> 01:39:04,291
And I loved you
and I didn't want to lose you.

2093
01:39:04,375 --> 01:39:07,205
But I'm in my twenties,
and I didn't want to lose that too,

2094
01:39:07,291 --> 01:39:08,831
and I kinda did!

2095
01:39:09,291 --> 01:39:11,671
And you wanted so much so fast.

2096
01:39:11,750 --> 01:39:13,460
I didn't even want to get married.

2097
01:39:13,541 --> 01:39:15,131
And fuck it!

2098
01:39:15,458 --> 01:39:17,168
There's so much I didn't do.

2099
01:39:17,250 --> 01:39:19,920
- Thanks for that!
- You're welcome!

2100
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:23,170
I can't believe
I have to know you forever!

2101
01:39:23,250 --> 01:39:25,330
You're fucking insane!

2102
01:39:26,125 --> 01:39:28,325
And you're fucking winning!

2103
01:39:28,958 --> 01:39:30,538
Are you kidding me?

2104
01:39:30,916 --> 01:39:32,746
I wanted to be married.

2105
01:39:33,291 --> 01:39:34,631
I'd already lost!

2106
01:39:35,083 --> 01:39:37,423
You didn't love me as much as I loved you!

2107
01:39:39,291 --> 01:39:40,961
What does that have to do with LA?

2108
01:39:43,291 --> 01:39:44,131
What?

2109
01:39:44,208 --> 01:39:47,628
You're so merged
with your own selfishness,

2110
01:39:47,708 --> 01:39:50,828
you don't even identify it
as selfishness anymore!

2111
01:39:51,208 --> 01:39:53,458
You're such a dick!

2112
01:39:53,541 --> 01:39:56,171
Every day I wake up
and I hope you're dead!

2113
01:39:56,250 --> 01:39:59,290
Dead, like if I could guarantee
Henry would be okay,

2114
01:39:59,375 --> 01:40:03,205
I'd hope you'd get an illness,
and then get hit by a car and die!

2115
01:40:22,958 --> 01:40:24,998
Oh, God!

2116
01:40:34,958 --> 01:40:35,958
I'm sorry.

2117
01:40:37,708 --> 01:40:38,708
Me too.

2118
01:41:04,583 --> 01:41:06,883
Okay. No, we can make this nice.

2119
01:41:07,250 --> 01:41:10,630
Um, I would take the smaller plants
and put them by the window.

2120
01:41:11,333 --> 01:41:13,923
And, uh, do you have things
we can put on the walls?

2121
01:41:33,541 --> 01:41:35,631
All right, that's it.
Thank you very much.

2122
01:41:35,708 --> 01:41:38,078
We miss you,
and it looks great, really.

2123
01:41:38,166 --> 01:41:39,851
- Let us know how it goes, okay?
- All right.

2124
01:41:39,875 --> 01:41:41,955
I'll see you guys on, uh... on Monday.

2125
01:41:42,291 --> 01:41:44,921
- Love you.
- All right, love you too. Bye.

2126
01:42:09,375 --> 01:42:11,285
Why do we have so many plants
all of a sudden?

2127
01:42:11,375 --> 01:42:14,059
We'll have to return some of this stuff,
so don't get too used to it.

2128
01:42:14,083 --> 01:42:16,043
I find plants kind of scary.

2129
01:42:16,375 --> 01:42:17,745
These plants are good guys.

2130
01:42:18,750 --> 01:42:20,330
Hey, come here.

2131
01:42:22,916 --> 01:42:23,916
Yeah?

2132
01:42:25,583 --> 01:42:28,753
Tomorrow, this woman is going to come
and visit us...

2133
01:42:29,750 --> 01:42:32,290
and be with us while we eat dinner.

2134
01:42:32,375 --> 01:42:34,285
- Is it your girlfriend?
- No, no.

2135
01:42:34,708 --> 01:42:37,418
- Is it Mommy's boyfriend?
- No. Why? Does Mommy have a boyfriend?

2136
01:42:37,500 --> 01:42:39,580
I don't know. Does she?

2137
01:42:39,666 --> 01:42:42,076
- I don't know.
- I don't know.

2138
01:42:43,500 --> 01:42:45,130
Why is someone watching us eat dinner?

2139
01:42:45,208 --> 01:42:46,578
I know, it's weird.

2140
01:42:47,375 --> 01:42:49,075
It's just something we have to do.

2141
01:42:49,500 --> 01:42:51,000
Which has to do with...

2142
01:42:51,541 --> 01:42:53,791
Mommy and me figuring out everything...

2143
01:42:54,750 --> 01:42:56,080
and how we're going to be.

2144
01:42:57,041 --> 01:42:58,041
Um...

2145
01:42:58,791 --> 01:42:59,791
You know?

2146
01:43:00,958 --> 01:43:02,128
Will you read to me?

2147
01:43:03,291 --> 01:43:04,461
Sure. Grab your book.

2148
01:43:05,625 --> 01:43:07,455
Do you use drugs or alcohol?

2149
01:43:07,875 --> 01:43:08,875
I drink alcohol.

2150
01:43:09,500 --> 01:43:11,250
How much alcohol do you drink?

2151
01:43:12,666 --> 01:43:13,666
Hmm...

2152
01:43:13,708 --> 01:43:15,828
I don't know, a glass of wine with dinner.

2153
01:43:16,083 --> 01:43:18,043
- Sometimes more.
- How much more?

2154
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:21,630
It's... Sometimes a...

2155
01:43:21,958 --> 01:43:23,038
a few...

2156
01:43:23,791 --> 01:43:27,211
I... sometimes split a bottle of wine
with someone.

2157
01:43:27,291 --> 01:43:29,351
- Okay, who do you split it with?
- I mean...

2158
01:43:29,375 --> 01:43:32,955
if I'm having dinner with someone
and we order a bottle of wine.

2159
01:43:33,041 --> 01:43:35,331
- Okay.
- You know, like at a restaurant.

2160
01:43:35,416 --> 01:43:39,246
When you say, "Do you want to go
by the glass or do we get a bottle?"

2161
01:43:40,166 --> 01:43:42,876
- You get a bottle?
- Well, sometimes.

2162
01:43:44,333 --> 01:43:46,543
I mean, sometimes I go by the glass.

2163
01:43:47,250 --> 01:43:48,380
You know, it depends.

2164
01:43:52,875 --> 01:43:56,035
Did you mean drugs ever?
I have done drugs.

2165
01:43:57,375 --> 01:43:58,375
In college.

2166
01:43:59,375 --> 01:44:02,205
- Anything since you've been...
- I... I don't do it regularly.

2167
01:44:02,291 --> 01:44:04,011
Anything since you've been
a mother?

2168
01:44:06,375 --> 01:44:07,665
Pot a few times.

2169
01:44:08,708 --> 01:44:11,628
Coke once at a party.
I mean, Henry wasn't with me.

2170
01:44:14,208 --> 01:44:17,168
What would you say
are your strengths as a parent?

2171
01:44:19,458 --> 01:44:20,458
Uh...

2172
01:44:25,291 --> 01:44:26,291
I listen.

2173
01:44:27,583 --> 01:44:28,583
I play.

2174
01:44:30,958 --> 01:44:33,538
I-I put in the time. I...

2175
01:44:34,250 --> 01:44:35,250
love...

2176
01:44:36,166 --> 01:44:37,746
taking care of him...

2177
01:44:38,500 --> 01:44:40,080
watching him grow.

2178
01:44:42,166 --> 01:44:43,166
And sometimes...

2179
01:44:43,708 --> 01:44:47,458
what they say about "it goes so fast"
is true, but...

2180
01:44:48,916 --> 01:44:49,956
sometimes it's not.

2181
01:44:50,458 --> 01:44:53,128
Sometimes it goes too slow, honestly.

2182
01:44:54,500 --> 01:44:56,170
What are your weaknesses?

2183
01:44:59,083 --> 01:45:01,753
I'm too precise. I care too much.

2184
01:45:02,500 --> 01:45:04,420
Are those weaknesses?

2185
01:45:06,458 --> 01:45:07,458
Maybe not.

2186
01:45:10,583 --> 01:45:13,213
You know, he can be an asshole and...

2187
01:45:13,958 --> 01:45:16,601
I can get really pissed off,
and I'll call him on being an asshole...

2188
01:45:16,625 --> 01:45:18,025
I'm going to stop you there.

2189
01:45:18,458 --> 01:45:20,578
When you do this for real,
don't ever say that.

2190
01:45:20,666 --> 01:45:22,826
People don't accept mothers
who drink too much wine

2191
01:45:22,916 --> 01:45:24,916
and yell at their child
and call him an asshole.

2192
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:26,500
I get it. I do it too.

2193
01:45:27,208 --> 01:45:29,288
We can accept an imperfect dad.

2194
01:45:29,375 --> 01:45:33,665
Let's face it, the idea of a good father
was only invented like 30 years ago.

2195
01:45:34,208 --> 01:45:37,208
Before that,
fathers were expected to be silent

2196
01:45:37,291 --> 01:45:41,001
and absent and unreliable and selfish,

2197
01:45:41,125 --> 01:45:43,325
and can all say
we want them to be different.

2198
01:45:43,708 --> 01:45:46,788
But on some basic level,
we accept them.

2199
01:45:47,083 --> 01:45:49,133
We love them for their fallibilities,

2200
01:45:49,208 --> 01:45:53,038
but people absolutely don't accept
those same failings in mothers.

2201
01:45:53,125 --> 01:45:56,165
We don't accept it structurally
and we don't accept it spiritually.

2202
01:45:56,250 --> 01:45:59,920
Because the basis
of our Judeo-Christian whatever

2203
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:03,460
is Mary, Mother of Jesus,
and she's perfect.

2204
01:46:03,708 --> 01:46:06,458
She's a virgin who gives birth,

2205
01:46:06,916 --> 01:46:11,456
unwaveringly supports her child
and holds his dead body when he's gone.

2206
01:46:12,041 --> 01:46:14,751
And the dad isn't there.
He didn't even do the fucking.

2207
01:46:15,083 --> 01:46:16,213
God is in heaven.

2208
01:46:17,208 --> 01:46:21,248
God is the father
and God didn't show up.

2209
01:46:21,541 --> 01:46:25,501
So, you have to be perfect, and Charlie
can be a fuck up and it doesn't matter.

2210
01:46:26,625 --> 01:46:29,915
You will always be held
to a different, higher standard.

2211
01:46:30,333 --> 01:46:33,503
And it's fucked up,
but that's the way it is.

2212
01:46:42,791 --> 01:46:44,881
Ooh! Whoosh!

2213
01:46:45,208 --> 01:46:46,208
Oh.

2214
01:47:00,458 --> 01:47:03,958
Oh. I think I rang the wrong bell.
Nancy Katz.

2215
01:47:04,041 --> 01:47:05,331
Hi, I'm Charlie Barber.

2216
01:47:05,958 --> 01:47:07,628
Henry's just playing in his room.

2217
01:47:09,125 --> 01:47:10,495
Nancy, can I get you anything?

2218
01:47:10,583 --> 01:47:13,583
Um, I'm easy. A glass of water?

2219
01:47:22,375 --> 01:47:24,075
It's a new apartment.

2220
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:32,000
Shall we go in here?

2221
01:47:32,291 --> 01:47:33,291
Sure.

2222
01:47:40,125 --> 01:47:41,125
Um...

2223
01:47:50,458 --> 01:47:53,378
Um, what's a day like
for the two of you here?

2224
01:47:53,916 --> 01:47:56,206
Well, if he has school,
I take him there, of course,

2225
01:47:56,291 --> 01:47:58,331
and pick him up, assuming I can do both.

2226
01:47:58,583 --> 01:48:00,713
What prevents you from picking him up?

2227
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:02,000
Um...

2228
01:48:02,458 --> 01:48:05,788
You know, work. I'm preparing a play
I'm directing in a few months.

2229
01:48:06,083 --> 01:48:07,253
Oh, what is that?

2230
01:48:07,666 --> 01:48:10,576
Kasimir and Karoline by Ödön von Horváth.

2231
01:48:10,666 --> 01:48:12,536
We’re doing it at the Barrow in New York.

2232
01:48:12,625 --> 01:48:14,125
So, you have to be away?

2233
01:48:14,208 --> 01:48:17,328
Yes, recently, since Nicole's
been working on the show in LA,

2234
01:48:17,416 --> 01:48:18,916
I come back and forth a lot.

2235
01:48:19,375 --> 01:48:21,055
- That sounds difficult.
- It is.

2236
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,920
And expensive. I'll try to take him
with me some of the time,

2237
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
but Nicole doesn't like for him
to fly so much.

2238
01:48:27,083 --> 01:48:30,713
Well, that can be hard on a child,
all that recycled air.

2239
01:48:32,500 --> 01:48:33,920
Well, he's sturdy.

2240
01:48:34,500 --> 01:48:36,790
Some parents won't take their kids
to a restaurant

2241
01:48:36,875 --> 01:48:38,705
because of these superbugs.

2242
01:48:39,291 --> 01:48:41,131
Uh-huh.

2243
01:48:42,916 --> 01:48:46,496
I noticed on one visit to Los Angeles,
you came on a Sunday

2244
01:48:46,583 --> 01:48:48,003
and left on a Thursday.

2245
01:48:48,083 --> 01:48:49,883
Why not stay for a weekend?

2246
01:48:50,375 --> 01:48:55,375
Oh. Um, on that time,
I had tech for Electra in New York.

2247
01:48:55,791 --> 01:48:56,961
What's that?

2248
01:48:57,916 --> 01:48:59,746
It was my Broadway debut.

2249
01:48:59,833 --> 01:49:02,043
Oh, I don't know what "tech" is.

2250
01:49:02,125 --> 01:49:05,575
It's the technical part of the production.
You figure out the lights.

2251
01:49:05,666 --> 01:49:07,851
- And Monday's our day off.
- What's a weekend day like?

2252
01:49:07,875 --> 01:49:10,535
Well, out here, he has basketball
on Saturday at 12.

2253
01:49:10,625 --> 01:49:11,745
Eleven, I'm sorry.

2254
01:49:11,833 --> 01:49:14,253
And so, we go there.
And then, afterwards...

2255
01:49:15,208 --> 01:49:18,708
maybe we'll get lunch somewhere,
and then, if there's a movie to see...

2256
01:49:18,958 --> 01:49:20,578
Does he like basketball?

2257
01:49:20,666 --> 01:49:21,666
He does.

2258
01:49:21,875 --> 01:49:25,245
His coach, uh, Rick, says
he's a good dribbler, and I've seen that.

2259
01:49:25,708 --> 01:49:26,878
- Uh-huh.
- Ron.

2260
01:49:27,708 --> 01:49:29,668
Sorry, his coach's name is Ron.

2261
01:49:29,750 --> 01:49:31,250
Rick's his dentist in New York.

2262
01:49:31,333 --> 01:49:34,543
Well, you know our home home was...
is in New York.

2263
01:49:34,625 --> 01:49:35,955
That's where we live.

2264
01:49:36,041 --> 01:49:38,171
New York is a long way from here.

2265
01:49:38,708 --> 01:49:40,458
Well, we like it because we can walk.

2266
01:49:40,541 --> 01:49:42,041
You can walk here.

2267
01:49:42,416 --> 01:49:43,416
Not really.

2268
01:49:43,458 --> 01:49:44,918
And the space...

2269
01:49:51,291 --> 01:49:52,671
Do you like your school?

2270
01:49:53,625 --> 01:49:54,625
I love it.

2271
01:49:54,958 --> 01:49:57,078
What's your favorite part
about it?

2272
01:49:57,541 --> 01:49:58,541
I don't know.

2273
01:50:00,041 --> 01:50:01,041
Maybe gym.

2274
01:50:01,333 --> 01:50:02,543
You like math.

2275
01:50:03,708 --> 01:50:04,828
Not anymore.

2276
01:50:06,625 --> 01:50:07,825
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

2277
01:50:07,916 --> 01:50:10,416
- But you're getting really good at it.
- No.

2278
01:50:11,541 --> 01:50:12,961
Well, you are, but...

2279
01:50:15,708 --> 01:50:17,998
What do you and your dad
like to do together?

2280
01:50:18,708 --> 01:50:21,288
When I'm at my dad's,
we sometimes watch a movie,

2281
01:50:21,375 --> 01:50:22,995
or build a Lego, or something.

2282
01:50:23,791 --> 01:50:25,631
My dad's a great Lego builder.

2283
01:50:26,041 --> 01:50:27,381
And at your mom's?

2284
01:50:28,125 --> 01:50:31,625
At home, I have most of my toys,
and there's a pool,

2285
01:50:32,125 --> 01:50:34,165
and I have a tree house and jungle gym.

2286
01:50:35,875 --> 01:50:39,285
We have super secret treasure hunt,
which is really fun.

2287
01:50:40,708 --> 01:50:44,208
- Sweetheart?
- Army men ride in here and...

2288
01:50:44,291 --> 01:50:45,921
Want to help me set the table?

2289
01:50:46,500 --> 01:50:47,420
Do I have to?

2290
01:50:47,500 --> 01:50:50,080
- Just come in here and grab a plate.
- I'm playing.

2291
01:50:50,166 --> 01:50:51,166
Henry?

2292
01:50:52,083 --> 01:50:53,463
Okay.

2293
01:50:54,375 --> 01:50:55,375
Fine.

2294
01:50:59,458 --> 01:51:01,288
- Why are you being like this?
- What?

2295
01:51:01,375 --> 01:51:03,245
If I ask you to help out, help out.

2296
01:51:03,333 --> 01:51:05,503
- What is this?
- Special Meal.

2297
01:51:06,333 --> 01:51:07,713
What are the green things?

2298
01:51:08,291 --> 01:51:10,381
There aren't green things in Special Meal.

2299
01:51:10,458 --> 01:51:12,748
- It's just a garnish.
- Ugh.

2300
01:51:12,833 --> 01:51:13,833
I'll take it off.

2301
01:51:14,875 --> 01:51:16,875
I don't want to eat anything it touched.

2302
01:51:16,958 --> 01:51:20,668
- It doesn't change the taste of anything.
- I might want to be a vegetarian.

2303
01:51:21,291 --> 01:51:22,461
Mom's a vegetarian.

2304
01:51:22,541 --> 01:51:23,921
Is she a vegetarian now?

2305
01:51:24,500 --> 01:51:26,300
- Yeah.
- Well, then, you should like garnish.

2306
01:51:26,375 --> 01:51:28,245
It's all garnish, vegetarianism.

2307
01:51:30,291 --> 01:51:31,711
I'm done with my water.

2308
01:51:41,750 --> 01:51:43,040
Sure I can't get you anything?

2309
01:51:43,125 --> 01:51:44,825
No, I'm fine, thank you.

2310
01:51:47,458 --> 01:51:48,828
Do the thing with the knife.

2311
01:51:48,916 --> 01:51:50,746
No, I'm not.

2312
01:51:51,708 --> 01:51:52,708
No.

2313
01:51:53,500 --> 01:51:54,500
Come on.

2314
01:51:54,750 --> 01:51:55,960
It's not a dinner thing.

2315
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:00,460
It's not an any time thing.

2316
01:52:00,958 --> 01:52:02,628
What's the thing with the knife?

2317
01:52:03,458 --> 01:52:04,628
It's hilarious.

2318
01:52:04,708 --> 01:52:07,168
No, it's dumb.
I have a small knife on my keychain,

2319
01:52:07,250 --> 01:52:08,500
which is only for adults.

2320
01:52:10,208 --> 01:52:11,958
And I do a thing with it sometimes.

2321
01:52:13,458 --> 01:52:15,038
You said I could get a knife.

2322
01:52:15,541 --> 01:52:17,421
A jackknife, yeah, when you're older.

2323
01:52:18,125 --> 01:52:19,125
Like ten.

2324
01:52:19,583 --> 01:52:21,003
No, like 20.

2325
01:52:21,666 --> 01:52:22,666
Yeah.

2326
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:32,250
Dime, rime, lime, pime, sime...

2327
01:52:32,333 --> 01:52:34,373
Honey, stop guessing.
You're so close. Stay with it.

2328
01:52:34,416 --> 01:52:36,536
Ugh, I don't want to do it.

2329
01:52:36,708 --> 01:52:40,208
- What's the first letter?
- I don't want to do it. Can I do the iPad?

2330
01:52:40,291 --> 01:52:41,751
No, look. What's the first letter?

2331
01:52:42,125 --> 01:52:44,285
- I don't want to.
- It's a T. What sound does T make?

2332
01:52:44,375 --> 01:52:46,705
- Tuh.
- Right. Then just do the rest of it.

2333
01:52:47,291 --> 01:52:48,291
Dime.

2334
01:52:49,166 --> 01:52:50,036
No.

2335
01:52:50,125 --> 01:52:52,415
You have "tuh" and "ime." What is that?

2336
01:52:55,541 --> 01:52:56,541
Time.

2337
01:52:57,083 --> 01:52:58,083
It's time.

2338
01:52:59,333 --> 01:53:00,333
It's time.

2339
01:53:05,375 --> 01:53:06,375
You'll see, honey.

2340
01:53:06,458 --> 01:53:09,498
One day, it's just going to click
and you'll be able to read everything.

2341
01:53:10,333 --> 01:53:11,543
I need a break.

2342
01:53:11,958 --> 01:53:13,748
Can I go play in my room?

2343
01:53:13,833 --> 01:53:14,833
Sure.

2344
01:53:17,083 --> 01:53:18,083
Hey.

2345
01:53:20,250 --> 01:53:21,250
Yeah?

2346
01:53:38,625 --> 01:53:40,415
Do you ever observe married people?

2347
01:53:40,500 --> 01:53:41,670
No. Why would I?

2348
01:53:42,500 --> 01:53:44,290
- I was kidding.
- Oh.

2349
01:53:55,666 --> 01:53:58,996
The knife thing is...
I carry this knife on my keychain,

2350
01:53:59,083 --> 01:54:00,793
which his mother got me, actually.

2351
01:54:02,500 --> 01:54:05,000
And I do this thing for his mom
where I pretend to cut myself,

2352
01:54:05,083 --> 01:54:07,753
but I retract the blade,
but I-I don't do it with him.

2353
01:54:11,041 --> 01:54:12,381
Oh.

2354
01:54:13,250 --> 01:54:14,790
- That's fine.
- Are you okay?

2355
01:54:14,875 --> 01:54:17,245
Yeah, I must not have retracted
the blade all the way.

2356
01:54:17,333 --> 01:54:18,793
- Do you need...
- Yeah.

2357
01:54:20,208 --> 01:54:22,378
Yeah, no, it's fine.

2358
01:54:22,791 --> 01:54:24,041
What else can I tell you?

2359
01:54:24,916 --> 01:54:27,916
- Um, I think I have enough.
- You have enough?

2360
01:54:28,416 --> 01:54:30,996
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Totally. I'm fine.

2361
01:54:31,625 --> 01:54:34,535
Uh, well, I'll leave you guys for tonight.

2362
01:54:35,125 --> 01:54:36,125
Oh, okay.

2363
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:40,080
I'll be in touch
if I have further questions.

2364
01:54:41,166 --> 01:54:42,666
Uh... Oh, thanks.

2365
01:54:42,750 --> 01:54:43,750
Um...

2366
01:54:44,833 --> 01:54:46,463
Oh, thanks. Um...

2367
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,210
Thanks. Thank you for the water.

2368
01:54:51,291 --> 01:54:53,831
- Oh, yeah, sure.
- Are you sure you're okay?

2369
01:54:53,916 --> 01:54:55,286
- Yeah.
- Okay.

2370
01:54:56,250 --> 01:54:57,460
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

2371
01:55:02,416 --> 01:55:03,826
Oh. Sorry.

2372
01:55:05,250 --> 01:55:06,250
All right, let...

2373
01:55:09,041 --> 01:55:10,381
I think you turn the...

2374
01:55:14,125 --> 01:55:15,455
- Okay.
- Sorry.

2375
01:55:15,958 --> 01:55:16,958
Okay.

2376
01:56:20,458 --> 01:56:21,788
Dad, are you okay?

2377
01:56:22,500 --> 01:56:23,880
Yeah, I'm just tired.

2378
01:56:41,083 --> 01:56:42,633
Dad, did she like us?

2379
01:56:44,708 --> 01:56:47,128

2412
01:58:23,208 --> 01:58:24,208
So...

2413
01:58:24,375 --> 01:58:26,745
because Charlie dropped his claim
to New York,

2414
01:58:26,833 --> 01:58:27,883
we're mostly done.

2415
01:58:28,166 --> 01:58:29,456
Jay's lost interest,

2416
01:58:29,625 --> 01:58:31,955
and Ted, his associate,
is doing the paperwork.

2417
01:58:32,041 --> 01:58:33,791
And we're not taking any money, right?

2418
01:58:33,875 --> 01:58:36,075
We withdrew our claim for the MacArthur,

2419
01:58:36,166 --> 01:58:38,326
which I think
we could have gotten, by the way,

2420
01:58:38,416 --> 01:58:40,666
and they're not asking
for any of the show.

2421
01:58:41,791 --> 01:58:43,381
Thank you for everything, Nora.

2422
01:58:43,708 --> 01:58:45,128
You're welcome, doll.

2423
01:58:45,875 --> 01:58:47,625
To your new home in LA.

2424
01:58:51,416 --> 01:58:52,416
Mmm.

2425
01:58:52,750 --> 01:58:53,750
And...

2426
01:58:53,916 --> 01:58:55,286
whenever Charlie is in LA,

2427
01:58:55,375 --> 01:58:58,415
I got the custody breakdown to be 55/45.

2428
01:58:58,875 --> 01:59:01,785
So you'll have Henry an extra day
every two weeks.

2429
01:59:02,208 --> 01:59:03,578
I thought we made it equal.

2430
01:59:03,750 --> 01:59:05,420
I tweaked it at the last minute.

2431
01:59:05,500 --> 01:59:08,330
I just didn't want him
to be able to say he got 50/50,

2432
01:59:08,416 --> 01:59:09,876
bragging to his friends.

2433
01:59:10,375 --> 01:59:12,415
- But I don't want to do that.
- Take it.

2434
01:59:12,875 --> 01:59:13,915
You won.

2435
01:59:15,541 --> 01:59:16,541
Uh-huh.

2436
01:59:40,333 --> 01:59:42,583
Hi. You look like a guy
who really cares about animals.

2437
01:59:42,666 --> 01:59:43,666
Nope.

2438
02:00:03,416 --> 02:00:05,206
Oh, my God!

2439
02:00:05,458 --> 02:00:06,458
Hi.

2440
02:00:21,750 --> 02:00:24,130
The couch was technically hers,
pre-marriage.

2441
02:00:24,208 --> 02:00:26,128
But I mean... it was our couch.

2442
02:00:26,208 --> 02:00:28,048
It's not like I was going to buy
another couch.

2443
02:00:28,083 --> 02:00:30,483
But then when it comes time to split,
it's suddenly her couch

2444
02:00:30,541 --> 02:00:31,921
and I have no couch, and...

2445
02:00:32,625 --> 02:00:33,915
Hey, guys, what's up?

2446
02:00:34,791 --> 02:00:37,041
I'm sitting on the floor
is the short version.

2447
02:00:39,666 --> 02:00:42,416
I'm sorry.
This is all so self-pitying and boring.

2448
02:00:42,500 --> 02:00:43,500
No, come on.

2449
02:00:43,583 --> 02:00:45,333
No, it's so stupid. I'm sorry.

2450
02:00:45,416 --> 02:00:48,246

Hello?

2504
02:04:19,916 --> 02:04:21,246
Hello?

2505
02:04:22,916 --> 02:04:25,036
- Hi. Sorry, the door was open.
- Shh.

2506
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:27,040
Oh, okay.

2507
02:04:29,291 --> 02:04:30,501
Whoa! Gotcha!

2508
02:04:30,583 --> 02:04:31,583
Aah!

2509
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:33,500
Oh, Charlie!

2510
02:04:34,083 --> 02:04:36,583
Oh! Was your flight okay?

2511
02:04:36,666 --> 02:04:38,126
- Yeah.
- Carter.

2512
02:04:38,208 --> 02:04:39,288
Charlie.

2513
02:04:39,375 --> 02:04:40,535
Nicole's still at work.

2514
02:04:48,083 --> 02:04:49,333
- Hi.
- Hi.

2515
02:04:49,416 --> 02:04:50,416
Can I get a hug?

2516
02:04:55,666 --> 02:04:57,076
- Hey, how'd it go?
- Hey.

2517
02:04:57,166 --> 02:05:00,226
Good, yeah. Donny's dead now. We shot
the scene where he merges with the ficus.

2518
02:05:00,250 --> 02:05:02,531
- Henry's upstairs.
- She got an Emmy nomination.

2519
02:05:02,750 --> 02:05:05,210
- She's a great actress.
- No, for directing.

2520
02:05:06,875 --> 02:05:08,705
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

2521
02:05:08,791 --> 02:05:11,541
Now I know what you were
so obsessed with all the time.

2522
02:05:11,625 --> 02:05:13,535
- Um, we should get ready.
- Yeah.

2523
02:05:13,625 --> 02:05:15,517
- We're the Beatles.
- Come on, Charlie.

2524
02:05:15,541 --> 02:05:17,101
I didn't really get a costume together.

2525
02:05:17,125 --> 02:05:19,392
- You could be George Martin.
- I don't need to be anything.

2526
02:05:19,416 --> 02:05:21,767
- You've got to be something.
- A ghost. I'll get you a sheet.

2527
02:05:21,791 --> 02:05:23,934
I have the album cover
if anyone needs to reference it.

2528
02:05:23,958 --> 02:05:26,828
And we should leave soon. I'm saying that
as much for me as anyone else.

2529
02:05:26,916 --> 02:05:29,476
- Am I John or George?
- Trick-or-treating starts at 5:00.

2530
02:05:29,500 --> 02:05:31,059
You're George. Nicole is John.

2531
02:05:37,916 --> 02:05:40,786
I wanted to tell you
I took a residency at UCLA.

2532
02:05:42,416 --> 02:05:44,876
I'm going to direct two plays
in rep at REDCAT.

2533
02:05:46,916 --> 02:05:47,916
Oh.

2534
02:05:48,708 --> 02:05:50,248
So, I'm going to be here for a while.

2535
02:05:53,458 --> 02:05:54,458
That's great.

2536
02:05:57,625 --> 02:05:58,625
Are you okay?

2537
02:06:01,125 --> 02:06:02,125
Yeah.

2538
02:06:04,625 --> 02:06:05,825
It's only good.

2539
02:06:06,125 --> 02:06:07,575
Nicole?

2540
02:06:07,666 --> 02:06:09,706
Can you help me with my zipper?

2541
02:06:30,083 --> 02:06:33,333
"Charlie is... in... cr..."

2542
02:06:33,416 --> 02:06:34,286
...something.

2543
02:06:34,375 --> 02:06:35,375
"...neat

2544
02:06:35,666 --> 02:06:39,076
and I re-ly on him

2545
02:06:39,500 --> 02:06:44,000
to keep things in or-der.

2546
02:06:44,875 --> 02:06:46,745
He is energy con..."

2547
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:51,210
- I don't know what this word is.
- You're getting so good at reading.

2548
02:06:51,875 --> 02:06:52,995
What is that?

2549
02:06:54,958 --> 02:06:59,498
"He doesn't look in the mirror too of-ten.

2550
02:06:59,958 --> 02:07:02,078
He cries eas-ily

2551
02:07:02,541 --> 02:07:04,541
in movies...

2552
02:07:05,625 --> 02:07:08,245
He is very self-suf..."

2553
02:07:09,166 --> 02:07:10,206
Self-sufficient.

2554
02:07:11,666 --> 02:07:14,826
"He can dar-n a sock..."

2555
02:07:14,916 --> 02:07:17,456
That means sew, like a hole.

2556
02:07:18,083 --> 02:07:21,083
"...and cook himself dinner

2557
02:07:21,541 --> 02:07:24,421
and ir..."

2558
02:07:24,500 --> 02:07:25,710
Break it into two parts.

2559
02:07:26,083 --> 02:07:27,793
"...Ur. On."

2560
02:07:27,875 --> 02:07:29,535
Not "ur" but "ire."

2561
02:07:29,833 --> 02:07:30,923
Ire. On.

2562
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:32,000
Iron.

2563
02:07:33,833 --> 02:07:35,043
"...a shirt.

2564
02:07:36,916 --> 02:07:40,206
He rarely gets def-eated,

2565
02:07:40,500 --> 02:07:42,960
which I fell...

2566
02:07:44,291 --> 02:07:47,631
feel like I always do.

2567
02:07:48,666 --> 02:07:52,036
Charlie takes all of my moods stead-ily.

2568
02:07:52,625 --> 02:07:54,825
He doesn't give in to them

2569
02:07:55,166 --> 02:07:57,576
or make me feel bad about them.

2570
02:07:58,458 --> 02:08:00,788
He's a great dress-er
and never looks em..."

2571
02:08:01,291 --> 02:08:03,381
- I don't know this one.
- Embarrassing.

2572
02:08:04,208 --> 02:08:05,208
"...embarrassing,

2573
02:08:05,666 --> 02:08:09,036
wh-ich is hard for a man."

2574
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:11,040
You read it now.

2575
02:08:13,333 --> 02:08:14,753
"He's very competitive.

2576
02:08:15,875 --> 02:08:17,575
He loves being a dad.

2577
02:08:18,625 --> 02:08:20,995
He loves all the things
you're supposed to hate,

2578
02:08:21,416 --> 02:08:22,826
like the tantrums,

2579
02:08:23,333 --> 02:08:24,753
the waking up at night.

2580
02:08:25,375 --> 02:08:27,915
It's almost annoying
how much he likes it,

2581
02:08:28,291 --> 02:08:29,671
but then, it's mostly nice.

2582
02:08:30,958 --> 02:08:32,998
He disappears into his own world.

2583
02:08:33,083 --> 02:08:35,173
He and Henry are alike that way.

2584
02:08:36,666 --> 02:08:37,876
He can tell...

2585
02:08:38,208 --> 02:08:40,998
people they have food in their teeth

2586
02:08:41,708 --> 02:08:44,578
or on their face in a way
that doesn't make them feel bad.

2587
02:08:45,500 --> 02:08:46,880
Charlie is self made.

2588
02:08:47,250 --> 02:08:49,710
His parents, I only met them once,

2589
02:08:49,791 --> 02:08:52,581
but he told me
there was a lot of alcohol...

2590
02:08:56,250 --> 02:08:58,750
He moved to New York from Indiana

2591
02:08:59,291 --> 02:09:00,421
with no safety net,

2592
02:09:00,500 --> 02:09:03,250
and now he's more New Yorker
than any New Yorker.

2593
02:09:04,041 --> 02:09:07,041
He's brilliant at creating family
out of whoever is around.

2594
02:09:07,416 --> 02:09:08,786
With the theater company...

2595
02:09:09,666 --> 02:09:11,166
he casts a spell...

2596
02:09:11,791 --> 02:09:14,251
that made everyone feel included.

2597
02:09:14,791 --> 02:09:17,541
No one, not even an intern,
was unimportant."

2598
02:09:18,916 --> 02:09:19,956
What's an intern?

2599
02:09:20,166 --> 02:09:21,536
Uh, it's like a...

2600
02:09:22,583 --> 02:09:24,173
helper, but who isn't paid.

2601
02:09:24,375 --> 02:09:25,575
Why aren't they paid?

2602
02:09:26,833 --> 02:09:28,583
They're young, they're learning.

2603
02:09:30,041 --> 02:09:32,921
I don't know, maybe if they do a good job,
they get paid later.

2604
02:09:33,166 --> 02:09:34,376
Okay, keep going.

2605
02:09:35,708 --> 02:09:39,628
"He could remember all the inside jokes,
he's extremely organized and thorough,

2606
02:09:39,833 --> 02:09:43,253
he's very clear about what he wants,
unlike me who can't always tell.

2607
02:09:43,791 --> 02:09:46,831
I fell in love with him
two seconds after I saw him.

2608
02:10:10,583 --> 02:10:12,213
And I'll never stop loving him,

2609
02:10:12,541 --> 02:10:14,671
even though
it doesn't make sense anymore."

2610
02:10:28,875 --> 02:10:31,325
- See you. Good seeing you.
- Good seeing you too.

2611
02:10:31,416 --> 02:10:33,076
- Oh, Charlie!
- G-ma.

2612
02:10:33,166 --> 02:10:34,786
I'm so happy you came.

2613
02:10:35,416 --> 02:10:36,826
I'll email you that article.

2614
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:38,080
- Yes, please do.
- Yeah.

2615
02:10:38,166 --> 02:10:40,326
- All right. Thank you.
- Take care.

2616
02:10:44,541 --> 02:10:47,501
We were going to bring him to dinner,
but he's so wiped out.

2617
02:10:47,583 --> 02:10:48,673
You want to take him?

2618
02:10:50,083 --> 02:10:52,043
- It's your night.
- I know.

2619
02:10:52,125 --> 02:10:54,059
- Yeah. I'll drop him back in the morning.
- Good.

2620
02:10:54,083 --> 02:10:56,309
Yeah, text me when you're up.
We'll figure something out.

2621
02:10:56,333 --> 02:10:58,173
You're going to go with your dad, okay?

2622
02:10:58,250 --> 02:10:59,420
- Okay.
- Yeah?

2623
02:11:10,500 --> 02:11:12,080
I love you.

2624
02:11:12,875 --> 02:11:14,075
I love you too.

2625
02:11:19,916 --> 02:11:20,916
Oh, hey.

2626
02:11:33,041 --> 02:11:34,041
Thanks.
