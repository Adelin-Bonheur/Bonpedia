[Ed] It was a big mistake
acknowledging this doll.

What's an inhuman spirit?

It's something demonic.

[nurse 2] So,
the doll was never possessed?

12
00:01:09,325 --> 00:01:12,227
[Lorraine] No,
it was used as a conduit.

13
00:01:12,229 --> 00:01:15,096
It was moved around to give
the impression of possession.

Demonic spirits
don't possess things.

this unusual feature,

How could you not tell me

197
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:36,016
what the Warrens did
for a living?

00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,121
I babysat the Smiths
for over two years

201
00:16:41,123 --> 00:16:42,322
and never told you
what they did.

202
00:16:42,324 --> 00:16:43,891
Oh, what do they do?

203
00:16:43,893 --> 00:16:45,291
They're podiatrists.

204
00:16:45,293 --> 00:16:46,959
- So not the same.

Well, obviously,
I'm coming over later.

00:16:48,964 --> 00:16:50,429
We do have
that social studies project

- that we need to work on.
- Uh...

208

We don't have any project.

209
00:16:53,536 --> 00:16:54,970
Okay, but how would
they know?

210
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:56,870
She's psychic.

211
00:16:56,872 --> 00:16:59,006
Then, they're heroes.

212
00:16:59,008 --> 00:17:00,573
I think
they're concerned parents

213
00:17:00,575 --> 00:17:02,074
who wouldn't want
negative influences

214

around their child.

So, what's it like
inside the house?

00:17:10,519 --> 00:17:12,985
Is it all creepy music

No. No, it's boring suburbia.

of tomato sauce in aisle five,

00:21:42,357 --> 00:21:44,060
[knocking continues]

327
00:21:46,861 --> 00:21:49,264
I think
there's someone at the door.

328
00:22:00,509 --> 00:22:02,174
[bell dinging]

329
00:22:02,176 --> 00:22:05,111
I was knocking on the door
for, like, ten minutes.

330
00:22:05,113 --> 00:22:07,246
[sighs]
How did you even get in?

331
00:22:07,248 --> 00:22:09,449
Back door.
Is this a spirit bell?

332
00:22:09,451 --> 00:22:11,117
- [bell dinging]
- What's a spirit bell?

333
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:13,552
It tells you if you're in
the presence of any spirits.

334
00:22:13,554 --> 00:22:15,355
- So, it is one.
- [Judy] No.

335
00:22:15,357 --> 00:22:17,757
It's just a bell.
My mom collects them.

336
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:19,295
- [turns off music]
- Oh.

337
00:22:19,794 --> 00:22:21,293
Who are you?

338
00:22:21,295 --> 00:22:24,364
She's Daniela,
and she leaves after cake.

339
00:22:24,366 --> 00:22:25,699
Oh, good!

340
00:22:25,701 --> 00:22:26,836
I love cake.

341
00:22:28,236 --> 00:22:30,302
So, Judy.

342
00:22:30,304 --> 00:22:34,376
Don't your parents, like, keep
any creepy stuff around?

343
00:22:36,278 --> 00:22:37,644
[Judy] No.

344
00:22:37,646 --> 00:22:40,082
They keep it all locked away
in a room.

345
00:22:42,583 --> 00:22:44,550
Well, can we at least
go in and look?

346
00:22:44,552 --> 00:22:45,687
[Mary Ellen] No!

347
00:22:47,321 --> 00:22:49,625
It's not really good
for anyone to go in there.

348
00:22:50,458 --> 00:22:51,460
How come?

349
00:22:52,461 --> 00:22:53,830
Just isn't.

350
00:22:55,397 --> 00:22:56,398
Wait.

351
00:22:57,765 --> 00:22:59,299
Here.

352
00:22:59,301 --> 00:23:00,302
Birthday present.

353
00:23:04,238 --> 00:23:05,472
What is it?

354
00:23:05,474 --> 00:23:06,641
Look inside.

355
00:23:13,814 --> 00:23:15,415
[Mary Ellen] How did you
even afford those?

356
00:23:15,417 --> 00:23:16,549
[Daniela]
They're my old ones.

357
00:23:16,551 --> 00:23:18,417
But I only ever used them once
'cause I broke my arm

358
00:23:18,419 --> 00:23:20,419
the first time I put them on.

359
00:23:20,421 --> 00:23:21,555
You're kidding.

360
00:23:21,557 --> 00:23:24,456
She looks
way more coordinated.

361
00:23:24,458 --> 00:23:25,892
They're gonna ruin the floors.

362
00:23:25,894 --> 00:23:28,228
Can we go around
the block, then?

363
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:29,930
- I don't think...
- [Daniela] Good idea.

364
00:23:29,932 --> 00:23:31,030
You guys go.

365
00:23:31,032 --> 00:23:33,136
I'll watch the cake
and make sure it doesn't burn.

366
00:23:34,636 --> 00:23:37,337
Fine. But don't snoop.
Don't touch.

367
00:23:37,339 --> 00:23:39,271
Don't do anything. Please?

368
00:23:39,273 --> 00:23:41,244
Stay in the kitchen.
Promise me.

369
00:23:41,743 --> 00:23:42,912
I promise.

370
00:24:17,946 --> 00:24:19,314
[sighs]

371
00:24:20,448 --> 00:24:21,516
[scoffs]

372
00:24:23,318 --> 00:24:24,651
Fuck it.

373
00:24:24,653 --> 00:24:27,490
I am calling out to the
spirits on the other side.

374
00:24:28,557 --> 00:24:30,726
Please unlock this door
and let me in.

375
00:24:43,938 --> 00:24:45,371
[sighs]

376
00:24:45,373 --> 00:24:46,541
Shit.

377
00:24:47,775 --> 00:24:48,843
[sighs]

378
00:24:58,986 --> 00:25:00,355
[sighs]

379
00:25:02,523 --> 00:25:04,392
[door creaking]

380
00:25:28,082 --> 00:25:29,619
[door creaking]

381
00:26:11,959 --> 00:26:13,461
Please don't judge me.

382
00:26:15,696 --> 00:26:16,765
[scoffs]

383
00:26:17,398 --> 00:26:18,466
Amen.

384
00:26:32,947 --> 00:26:34,816
[door creaking]

385
00:26:37,619 --> 00:26:38,821
Whoa.

386
00:26:42,757 --> 00:26:43,925
[exhales]

387
00:26:49,563 --> 00:26:50,565
Whoa.

388
00:28:08,676 --> 00:28:10,745
What'd you do
to get in there?

389
00:28:13,982 --> 00:28:15,518
[tapping]

390
00:28:41,009 --> 00:28:42,178
[chuckles softly]

391
00:28:42,711 --> 00:28:44,580
[clicking]

392
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,596
[notes playing]

393
00:30:13,234 --> 00:30:15,771
If there is a presence here
in this room,

394
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:18,674
please give me a sign.

395
00:30:23,677 --> 00:30:24,879
Any sign at all.

396
00:30:30,651 --> 00:30:31,719
Dad?

397
00:30:42,863 --> 00:30:43,932
[scoffs]

398
00:30:44,632 --> 00:30:45,633
This is stupid.

399
00:30:49,236 --> 00:30:50,305
[sniffles]

400
00:30:55,176 --> 00:30:56,244
[thuds]

401
00:32:25,166 --> 00:32:27,299
[alarm beeping]

402
00:32:27,301 --> 00:32:28,302
Shit.

403
00:32:31,473 --> 00:32:33,341
[muffled beeping]

404
00:32:43,118 --> 00:32:44,186
[thuds]

405
00:32:55,996 --> 00:32:57,331
[beeping continues]

406
00:32:59,501 --> 00:33:00,769
[door closes]

407
00:33:02,035 --> 00:33:03,970
You burnt the cake? Daniela.

408
00:33:03,972 --> 00:33:05,504
[sighs] Only the top.

409
00:33:05,506 --> 00:33:07,839
Just put frosting on it.

410
00:33:07,841 --> 00:33:09,308
She'll never know.

411
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:10,342
How'd it go with the skates?

412
00:33:10,344 --> 00:33:11,978
She loved them until she fell
on the way back

413
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:13,445
and skinned her knee.

414
00:33:13,447 --> 00:33:15,013
Better than breaking her arm.

415
00:33:15,015 --> 00:33:16,214
Where is she anyway?

416
00:33:16,216 --> 00:33:18,384
She's out
feeding the chickens.

417
00:33:18,386 --> 00:33:20,219
They have chickens?

418
00:33:20,221 --> 00:33:21,757
[chickens clucking]

419
00:33:24,158 --> 00:33:25,426
[Daniela] Hey. How's your knee?

420
00:33:26,026 --> 00:33:27,193
Oh. [exclaims]

421
00:33:27,195 --> 00:33:30,363
Looks like your jeans will
at least need some stitches.

422
00:33:30,365 --> 00:33:31,496
It's okay.

423
00:33:31,498 --> 00:33:32,934
Accidents happen.

424
00:33:37,504 --> 00:33:38,974
So, are you scared yet?

425
00:33:40,041 --> 00:33:42,008
Scared? What? No.

426
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:43,809
Who says they're scared?

427
00:33:43,811 --> 00:33:45,877
Kids in my class.

428
00:33:45,879 --> 00:33:47,579
Anthony Rios started it.

429
00:33:47,581 --> 00:33:48,915
I hate him.

430
00:33:48,917 --> 00:33:51,320
Wait. Tony Rios started it?

431
00:33:52,119 --> 00:33:53,789
Do you know him?

432
00:33:54,321 --> 00:33:57,123
Yeah, he's my brother.

433
00:33:57,125 --> 00:34:00,225
Anthony Rios is your brother?

434
00:34:00,227 --> 00:34:02,494
Yeah, I know.
Don't hold it against me.

435
00:34:02,496 --> 00:34:04,963
I don't like him either.

436
00:34:04,965 --> 00:34:06,869
You know,
he still wets the bed.

437
00:34:07,534 --> 00:34:09,335
You didn't hear it from me.

438
00:34:09,337 --> 00:34:11,039
Or maybe you did,
I don't care.

439
00:34:11,605 --> 00:34:13,271
Still, just...

440
00:34:13,273 --> 00:34:14,976
go a little easy on him.

441
00:34:15,610 --> 00:34:17,980
It's been a tough year.

442
00:34:21,148 --> 00:34:23,851
You lost somebody,
didn't you?

443
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,121
My dad. Uh...

444
00:34:27,922 --> 00:34:29,858
Did Mary Ellen tell you?

445
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:32,261
No.

446
00:34:33,127 --> 00:34:34,362
I just knew.

447
00:34:36,496 --> 00:34:38,630
- Um, for delivery.
- [song playing on record]

448
00:34:38,632 --> 00:34:41,467
Could I do one large, please?

449
00:34:41,469 --> 00:34:44,940
Um, it's gonna be
3506 Wayman Street.

450
00:34:46,107 --> 00:34:47,842
Oh, perfect. Thank you.

451
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:52,011
[doorbell rings]

452
00:34:52,013 --> 00:34:53,645
Coming.

453
00:34:53,647 --> 00:34:56,081
[doorbell ringing repeatedly]

454
00:34:56,083 --> 00:34:57,585
[quietly] Hold your horses.

455
00:34:59,186 --> 00:35:00,355
[banging on door]

456
00:35:07,127 --> 00:35:08,362
Who is it?

457
00:35:08,996 --> 00:35:10,331
[doorbell rings]

458
00:35:14,201 --> 00:35:15,536
Hello?

459
00:35:17,205 --> 00:35:18,540
Daniela?

460
00:35:27,147 --> 00:35:28,583
[girl] Is Annabelle there?

461
00:35:36,424 --> 00:35:38,123
Who?

462
00:35:38,125 --> 00:35:40,261
[girl] Can Annabelle
come out to play?

463
00:35:54,375 --> 00:35:55,608
I think you have
the wrong house.

464
00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:57,312
There's no Annabelle here.

465
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:01,547
Yes, she is.

466
00:36:01,549 --> 00:36:03,585
She's right behind you.

467
00:36:06,688 --> 00:36:08,557
- [girl giggling]
- [footsteps running away]

468
00:36:14,529 --> 00:36:17,395
People are just...
They're really weird about death.

469
00:36:17,397 --> 00:36:19,665
That's probably why the kids
pick on you at school.

470
00:36:19,667 --> 00:36:21,567
It scares them.

471
00:36:21,569 --> 00:36:24,036
They treat it like it's some
disease they don't wanna get,

472
00:36:24,038 --> 00:36:25,907
even though
everyone already has it.

473
00:36:26,975 --> 00:36:28,974
But here's the thing.

474
00:36:28,976 --> 00:36:30,643
I used to think
it was fatal and whammo.

475
00:36:30,645 --> 00:36:31,978
It's, like, out.

476
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:34,145
Like turning off a TV.

477
00:36:34,147 --> 00:36:35,447
Then I learned
about your parents

478
00:36:35,449 --> 00:36:36,549
and their whole exploration

479
00:36:36,551 --> 00:36:38,319
into the afterlife
and stuff...

480
00:36:40,587 --> 00:36:42,123
and they gave me hope.

481
00:36:43,623 --> 00:36:46,627
That maybe
life goes on somehow.

482
00:36:48,362 --> 00:36:49,364
Maybe...

483
00:36:50,364 --> 00:36:54,136
my darling dad
is still out there somewhere.

484
00:36:55,136 --> 00:36:56,569
"Darling dad"?

485
00:36:56,571 --> 00:36:58,371
It was a thing.

486
00:36:58,373 --> 00:37:01,376
He was darling dad,
and I was darling Daniela...

487
00:37:02,476 --> 00:37:03,545
Stupid. [chuckles]

488
00:37:05,212 --> 00:37:06,981
He's still out there,
you know.

489
00:37:08,148 --> 00:37:09,748
You think so?

490
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:11,686
My parents
would say he is, too.

491
00:37:32,373 --> 00:37:34,072
Where are you going?

492
00:37:34,074 --> 00:37:35,444
Be right back.

493
00:37:47,554 --> 00:37:48,723
[voice breaking] Dad?

494
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:07,208
Daniela?

495
00:38:16,817 --> 00:38:18,750
Daniela!

496
00:38:18,752 --> 00:38:21,753
- Where did she go?
- [footsteps thudding]

497
00:38:21,755 --> 00:38:22,755
[Mary Ellen]
What are you doing?

498
00:38:22,757 --> 00:38:25,260
Daniela, you're not supposed
to go down there!

499
00:38:27,395 --> 00:38:29,764
- What are you doing?
- I thought I saw something.

500
00:38:32,766 --> 00:38:34,035
What did you see?

501
00:38:37,371 --> 00:38:39,170
Forget it. It doesn't matter.

502
00:38:39,172 --> 00:38:41,042
[wood creaking]

503
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:05,600

[Judy screaming]

513
00:41:10,924 --> 00:41:11,926
Judy?

514
00:41:20,868 --> 00:41:21,869
Judy?

515
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:27,842
Judy?

516
00:41:30,578 --> 00:41:32,447
[door creaking]

517
00:41:36,350 --> 00:41:37,384
Judy?

518
00:41:41,621 --> 00:41:43,422
[Judy] In thee, O Lord,
do I put my trust.

519
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:45,023
Let me never be
put to confusion.

520
00:41:45,025 --> 00:41:46,824
Deliver me into
Thy righteousness

521
00:41:46,826 --> 00:41:48,494
and cause me to escape.
Incline Thine ear...

522
00:41:48,496 --> 00:41:50,362
[Mary Ellen]
Hey! Hey, Judy! Judy.

523
00:41:50,364 --> 00:41:51,800
What's going on? What's wrong?

524
00:41:53,768 --> 00:41:55,302
What's going on?

525
00:41:58,739 --> 00:41:59,941
What happened?

526
00:42:01,074 --> 00:42:02,243
Nothing.

527
00:42:02,576 --> 00:42:03,712
Judy...

528
00:42:06,013 --> 00:42:07,813
I just got scared.

529
00:42:07,815 --> 00:42:09,717
Scared of what?

530
00:42:13,554 --> 00:42:14,856
Sometimes...

531
00:42:15,855 --> 00:42:17,556
I see things.

532
00:42:17,558 --> 00:42:19,561
Like how my mom sees things.

533
00:42:23,831 --> 00:42:26,301
You mean like ghosts?

534
00:42:31,105 --> 00:42:32,907
Where do you see them?

535
00:42:34,875 --> 00:42:36,511
Everywhere I go.

536
00:42:42,850 --> 00:42:43,918
Judy...

537
00:42:45,618 --> 00:42:47,953
Ghosts used to be people.

538
00:42:47,955 --> 00:42:50,592
And not every person
you meet is bad...

539
00:42:52,092 --> 00:42:55,429
so maybe not all ghosts
are bad, either.

540
00:43:03,871 --> 00:43:05,637
[footsteps approaching]

541
00:43:05,639 --> 00:43:06,641
Daniela.

542
00:43:07,775 --> 00:43:09,708
- You have to see this.
- What?

543
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:11,944
It's this case the Warrens
investigated about this girl

544
00:43:11,946 --> 00:43:14,012
who was terrorized by
something called the Ferryman.

545
00:43:14,014 --> 00:43:15,848
Here's a picture
of the girl he killed.

546
00:43:15,850 --> 00:43:17,116
Look familiar?

547
00:43:17,118 --> 00:43:18,953
I mean,
you two could be sisters.

548
00:43:22,022 --> 00:43:25,025
Here's the rest of the file,
if you want to take a look.

549
00:43:32,799 --> 00:43:34,101
Look at all this stuff.

550
00:43:36,103 --> 00:43:37,472
[gasps]

551
00:43:40,007 --> 00:43:41,940
How cool.

552
00:43:41,942 --> 00:43:44,610
Okay, this is the file
on the Black Shuck.

553
00:43:44,612 --> 00:43:45,645
[Mary Ellen] The Black Shuck?

554
00:43:45,647 --> 00:43:47,579
[Daniela] It was a case
the Warrens investigated

555
00:43:47,581 --> 00:43:49,818
about a hellhound that
possessed a man in England.

556
00:43:51,451 --> 00:43:53,120
He terrorized the shit
out of this town.

557
00:44:03,431 --> 00:44:04,999
What's with the coins
over their eyes?

558
00:44:06,132 --> 00:44:07,134
What?

559
00:44:08,868 --> 00:44:10,201
[Daniela] Oh, I don't know.
I didn't get that far.

560
00:44:10,203 --> 00:44:12,570
They used to put them
over the eyes of the dead

561
00:44:12,572 --> 00:44:13,639
to pay the Ferryman,
so he could

562
00:44:13,641 --> 00:44:15,574
take their souls
to the underworld.

563
00:44:15,576 --> 00:44:16,942
It was his toll.

564
00:44:16,944 --> 00:44:19,011
Okay, we should go.

565
00:44:19,013 --> 00:44:21,712
It's okay. I sometimes
like to snoop, too.

566
00:44:21,714 --> 00:44:24,148
[Daniela] Do you know
what this does, Judy?

567
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:26,453
I think it's called
a Mourner's Bracelet.

568
00:44:28,822 --> 00:44:31,926
It helps you contact
your lost loved ones.

569
00:44:40,467 --> 00:44:42,166
- What's that?
- Um...

570
00:44:42,168 --> 00:44:44,806
It's a case my parents
investigated recently.

571
00:44:45,672 --> 00:44:47,105
The wedding dress.

572
00:44:47,107 --> 00:44:48,710
It haunts people.

573
00:44:49,777 --> 00:44:52,580
And it makes them violent.

574
00:44:54,214 --> 00:44:55,746
Where is the dress now?

575
00:44:55,748 --> 00:44:57,051
Down the hall
in the artifact room.

576
00:45:00,554 --> 00:45:03,191
I mean, that's where
all this stuff is.

577
00:45:03,790 --> 00:45:04,724
Right, Judy?

578
00:45:04,726 --> 00:45:06,961
- That's what you said earlier.
- Oh, um...

579
00:45:07,228 --> 00:45:08,559
Yeah.

580
00:45:08,561 --> 00:45:10,795
My dad says
that everything in there

581
00:45:10,797 --> 00:45:14,199
is either haunted, cursed,

582
00:45:14,201 --> 00:45:17,636
or used in some
ritualistic practice.

583
00:45:17,638 --> 00:45:19,070
What about the doll
that's in there?

584
00:45:19,072 --> 00:45:20,505
Because I read this interview
with your dad...

585
00:45:20,507 --> 00:45:21,509
No.

586
00:45:23,877 --> 00:45:25,513
Don't talk about her.

587
00:45:28,715 --> 00:45:29,717
Why not?

588
00:45:33,953 --> 00:45:36,156
She's in a case for a reason.

589
00:45:37,558 --> 00:45:39,224
Okay, we should go.

590
00:45:39,226 --> 00:45:40,291
I wonder what's on this.

591
00:45:40,293 --> 00:45:42,027
[Mary Ellen] No, Daniela! Wait!

592
00:45:42,029 --> 00:45:43,829

596
00:45:49,837 --> 00:45:51,906
<i>to obey me to the letter!</i>

597
00:45:56,543 --> 00:45:59,578
Okay, show's over.
Let's go do something else.

598
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:02,614
Do something that's
actually appropriate.

599
00:46:02,616 --> 00:46:03,648
[Daniela] Come on,

600
00:46:03,650 --> 00:46:05,520
don't you at least wanna hear
about the samurai?

601
00:46:12,058 --> 00:46:13,558
What about this one?

602
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:15,259
I don't remember that one.

603
00:46:15,261 --> 00:46:16,530
[Daniela] How do you play?

604
00:46:17,063 --> 00:46:18,933
Let's find out.

605
00:46:25,772 --> 00:46:27,940
Okay. Okay,
so you draw a card

606
00:46:27,942 --> 00:46:29,241
and whatever picture
it has on it

607
00:46:29,243 --> 00:46:30,576
is the object you try to find

608
00:46:30,578 --> 00:46:32,244
by feeling around
inside the box.

609
00:46:32,246 --> 00:46:34,179
If the object you pull out
matches the picture,

610
00:46:34,181 --> 00:46:35,183
then you get a point.

611
00:46:38,085 --> 00:46:39,585
You go first.

612
00:46:39,587 --> 00:46:40,655
Okay.

613
00:46:52,366 --> 00:46:53,902

00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,056
You gonna get that?

616
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:17,855
Yeah.

617
00:47:17,857 --> 00:47:19,958
Sorry, you guys keep playing.

618
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:20,994
Oh, got a point.

619
00:47:22,862 --> 00:47:23,864
Nice.

620
00:47:42,016 --> 00:47:43,351
[knocking on door]

621
00:47:46,219 --> 00:47:47,355
Hello?

622

[sighs]

623
00:48:05,406 --> 00:48:06,641
Hi, Mary Ellen.

624
00:48:07,241 --> 00:48:08,907
Hi.

625
00:48:08,909 --> 00:48:10,442
Remember how, at the store,

626
00:48:10,444 --> 00:48:12,376
Daniela said that
you were babysitting here?

627
00:48:12,378 --> 00:48:13,679
Yeah. Yeah.

628
00:48:13,681 --> 00:48:14,715
Me, too.

629
00:48:15,415 --> 00:48:17,351
Anyways, that's why I'm here.

630
00:48:17,851 --> 00:48:18,884
Oh.

631
00:48:18,886 --> 00:48:23,454
Bob, they don't really want me
having boys over.

632
00:48:23,456 --> 00:48:25,924
No, that's not what I meant.
I don't wanna come in.

633
00:48:25,926 --> 00:48:27,291
I just, uh...

634
00:48:27,293 --> 00:48:28,360
I mean, I would, but...

635
00:48:28,362 --> 00:48:30,331
[chuckles] Well...

636
00:48:31,364 --> 00:48:34,398
I just knew you were
gonna be here,

637
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:37,703
and I just wanted to come by
and talk to you

638
00:48:37,705 --> 00:48:39,371
without my stupid dad
or somebody interrupting.

640
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:43,744
[chuckles] Nice.

00:48:44,478 --> 00:48:45,980
You two sharing some pizza?

642
00:48:47,947 --> 00:48:49,884
- I should get the money.
- Yeah.

643
00:48:51,985 --> 00:48:54,018
Are you two, like...

644
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:56,188
I... I wish. [chuckles]

645
00:48:56,190 --> 00:48:59,159
You know you need to, like,
woo her, right?

646
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:02,027
- Woo her?
- Yeah.

647
00:49:02,029 --> 00:49:06,230
Guys like Mary Ellen,
they need to be wooed.

648
00:49:06,232 --> 00:49:08,366
You mean
girls like Mary Ellen.

649
00:49:08,368 --> 00:49:09,800
What did I say?

650
00:49:09,802 --> 00:49:10,902
Guys.

00:49:10,904 --> 00:49:12,204
[laughing]

652
00:49:12,206 --> 00:49:14,072
So, how do I woo her?

653
00:49:14,074 --> 00:49:16,741
There's only one way to woo.

654
00:49:16,743 --> 00:49:18,011
It's obvious.

655
00:49:18,478 --> 00:49:20,147

Sweet.

Thanks, and that means

01:35:14,732 --> 01:35:17,265
[Lorraine] Judy! What are you
doing up so early?

1150
01:35:17,267 --> 01:35:19,033
[Judy] Don't get mad...

1151
01:35:19,035 --> 01:35:21,005
[Ed] What happened
to your car?

1152
01:35:26,043 --> 01:35:27,676
Here we go.

1153
01:35:27,678 --> 01:35:29,448
We'll have
our own party, huh?

1154
01:35:36,152 --> 01:35:38,889
- What?
- Can you please take that off?

1155
01:35:46,664 --> 01:35:49,532
It won't always be like this,
I promise.

1156
01:35:49,534 --> 01:35:51,065
You know,
and sooner or later,

1157
01:35:51,067 --> 01:35:53,234
you'll find people
who understand.

1158
01:35:53,236 --> 01:35:55,637
And as for young Anthony,

1159
01:35:55,639 --> 01:35:57,609
he better hope I don't
run into him anytime soon.

1160
01:35:57,909 --> 01:35:59,675
Ed.

1161
01:35:59,677 --> 01:36:00,846
[doorbell ringing]

1162
01:36:12,822 --> 01:36:13,924
Happy birthday, Judy.

1163
01:36:15,125 --> 01:36:16,127
[Judy] Thank you.

1164
01:36:16,826 --> 01:36:17,862
Happy birthday.

1165
01:36:21,132 --> 01:36:24,602
I, uh, had a little talk
with my brother.

1166
01:36:24,901 --> 01:36:26,268
Thanks.

1167
01:36:26,270 --> 01:36:28,037
Come in.

1168
01:36:28,039 --> 01:36:30,542
[Mary Ellen] Is it okay
if my boyfriend joins?

1169
01:36:31,275 --> 01:36:32,210
Sure.

1170
01:36:34,078 --> 01:36:35,043
Um...

1171
01:36:35,045 --> 01:36:37,781
- Hi, uh, thanks for having us.
- [Ed] Hey.

1172
01:36:38,648 --> 01:36:39,982
Bob's-Got-Balls.

1173
01:36:39,984 --> 01:36:41,649
No kidding.

1174
01:36:41,651 --> 01:36:43,786
- [girl] Hi, Judy!
- Happy birthday, Judy!

1175
01:36:43,788 --> 01:36:45,354
- Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday!

1176
01:36:45,356 --> 01:36:48,090
- Hello, Judy, happy birthday.
- [Ed] Hey, guys, welcome.

1177
01:36:48,092 --> 01:36:49,891
- Keep comin'.
- [both chuckle]

1178
01:36:49,893 --> 01:36:51,359
[Anthony]
Happy birthday, Judy.

1179
01:36:51,361 --> 01:36:52,897
- Anthony?
- [Anthony] I'm really sorry.

1180
01:36:53,763 --> 01:36:55,734
Am I still invited?

1181
01:36:57,234 --> 01:36:58,270
Sure.

1182
01:37:04,040 --> 01:37:05,142
[Lorraine] Daniela?

1183
01:37:06,177 --> 01:37:07,976
I have something for you.

1184
01:37:07,978 --> 01:37:09,179
[Daniela] For me?

1185
01:37:11,882 --> 01:37:12,918
[sighs]

1186
01:37:20,991 --> 01:37:22,992
You found out the hard way

1187
01:37:22,994 --> 01:37:26,394
that there is a lot of evil
in this room.

1188
01:37:26,396 --> 01:37:28,799
But you know
what I actually like about it?

1189
01:37:31,067 --> 01:37:33,838
All the evil in here...

1190
01:37:35,106 --> 01:37:38,643
reminds me of all the good
that's out there.

1191
01:37:54,691 --> 01:37:56,293
[Lorraine whispers]
Darling Daniela.

1192
01:38:01,731 --> 01:38:03,399
Did Judy tell you that?

1193
01:38:03,401 --> 01:38:05,704
No. Your dad did.

1194
01:38:10,307 --> 01:38:13,678
He also tells me
that he misses you.

1195
01:38:15,945 --> 01:38:19,081
And to stop being
so hard on yourself,

1196
01:38:19,083 --> 01:38:21,315
'cause it was
not your fault.

1197
01:38:21,317 --> 01:38:22,820
[sobbing]

1198
01:38:23,920 --> 01:38:25,089
[sniffles]

1199
01:38:31,361 --> 01:38:33,030
Thank you.

1200
01:38:34,898 --> 01:38:36,364
Um... [sniffles]

1201
01:38:36,366 --> 01:38:37,433
I'm sorry.

1202
01:38:37,435 --> 01:38:38,801
Oh.

1203
01:38:38,803 --> 01:38:40,101
It's okay.

1204
01:38:40,103 --> 01:38:41,373
You're young.

1205
01:38:46,110 --> 01:38:48,277
You know,
when I was about your age,

1206
01:38:48,279 --> 01:38:51,447
I once ran off with
a boyfriend for three days

1207
01:38:51,449 --> 01:38:53,284
without telling my parents.

1208
01:38:54,285 --> 01:38:55,654
[chuckles]

1209
01:38:56,152 --> 01:38:58,153
I unleashed a demon.

1210
01:38:58,155 --> 01:38:59,758
So not the same thing.

1211
01:39:00,725 --> 01:39:02,727
Well, okay. True.

1212
01:39:03,494 --> 01:39:05,362
[both chuckle]

1213
01:39:08,932 --> 01:39:11,201
Does Mr. Warren know
about this boyfriend?

1214
01:39:12,136 --> 01:39:13,772
He was the boyfriend.

1215
01:39:18,275 --> 01:39:20,141
[Ed] Anybody wanna
hear a song? Whoa!

1216
01:39:20,143 --> 01:39:22,146
- [boy] Yeah!
- [all cheering]

1217
01:39:24,048 --> 01:39:25,950
[Ed] All right, okay.

1218
01:39:59,441 --> 01:40:04,441
