00:00:36,276 --> 00:00:39,413
<i>This man is worth $500,</i>

3
00:00:39,547 --> 00:00:41,916
<i>and this man's
going to collect.</i>

4
00:00:42,048 --> 00:00:43,450
<i>He's Jake Cahill,</i>

5
00:00:43,584 --> 00:00:44,952
<i>and he lives by...</i>

6
00:00:45,084 --> 00:00:46,786
Bounty Law.

7
00:00:46,919 --> 00:00:49,590
You don't ever bring them in
alive, do you, Jake?

8
00:00:49,724 --> 00:00:52,093
Not when there's three of them
and one of me.

9
00:00:57,331 --> 00:00:58,799
What are you looking at,
bounty killer?

10
00:00:58,932 --> 00:01:00,300
I'm looking
at an ugly owl-hoot

11
00:01:00,434 --> 00:01:02,803
about to get his jaw busted.

12
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:05,005
Amateurs try
and take men in alive.

13
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,242
Amateurs usually
don't make it.

14
00:01:09,377 --> 00:01:11,245
<i>Whether you're dead or alive,</i>

15
00:01:11,377 --> 00:01:14,948
<i>you're just a dollar sign</i>
<i>to Jake Cahill on</i> Bounty Law.

16
00:01:15,082 --> 00:01:17,651
<i>Thursdays at 8:30,
only on NBC.</i>

17
00:01:22,156 --> 00:01:23,023
Hello, everybody.

18
00:01:23,156 --> 00:01:24,325
This is Allen Kincade

19
00:01:24,457 --> 00:01:26,359
on the set
of the exciting hit NBC

20
00:01:26,493 --> 00:01:28,863
and Screen Gems television
series <i>Bounty Law.</i>

21
00:01:28,996 --> 00:01:30,798
Now, if you think
you're seeing double,

22
00:01:30,931 --> 00:01:32,433
don't adjust
your television sets

23
00:01:32,567 --> 00:01:34,635
because, well,
in a way, you are.

24
00:01:34,769 --> 00:01:36,603
To my right
is <i>Bounty Law</i> series lead

25
00:01:36,737 --> 00:01:38,939
and Jake Cahill himself,
Rick Dalton.

26
00:01:39,073 --> 00:01:41,842
And to my left is Rick's
stunt double, Cliff Booth.

27
00:01:41,975 --> 00:01:43,710
Welcome and thanks for
taking the time

28
00:01:43,844 --> 00:01:46,179
- to visit with us.
- It's our pleasure, Allen.

29
00:01:46,312 --> 00:01:48,082
So, Rick,
explain to the audience

30
00:01:48,216 --> 00:01:50,552
exactly what it is
a stunt double does.

31
00:01:51,484 --> 00:01:53,019
Well...

32
00:01:53,153 --> 00:01:56,157
actors are required to do
a lot of dangerous stuff.

33
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:59,225
Say Jake Cahill
gets shot off his horse.

34
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:01,561
Now, can I fall off
a horse?

35
00:02:01,695 --> 00:02:04,364
Yes, I can,
and, yes, I have.

36
00:02:07,868 --> 00:02:10,638
But say I fall off wrong
and I sprain my wrist

37
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:12,206
or I... or I
twist my ankle.

38
00:02:12,339 --> 00:02:15,341
Now, that can put
an undue burden on production

39
00:02:15,476 --> 00:02:17,544
because now maybe
I can't work for a week.

40
00:02:17,678 --> 00:02:20,381
So Cliff here is meant to help
carry the load.

41
00:02:20,514 --> 00:02:22,883
Is that how you'd describe
your job, Cliff?

42
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:26,119
What, carrying his load?
Yeah, that's about right.

43
00:02:30,423 --> 00:02:33,026
Join me next week on the set
of <i>The Dick Van Dyke Show,</i>

44
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,996
where I'll be talking
to comical cutups,

45
00:02:35,129 --> 00:02:36,730
Morey Amsterdam
and Rose Marie.

46
00:02:36,863 --> 00:02:40,100
Till then, this is Allen Kincade
signing off from Hollywood.

47
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:58,812
Hi. I missed you.

48
00:04:02,982 --> 00:04:04,885
The black one.
And the flowers.

49
00:04:05,018 --> 00:04:06,352
Flowers, Ava, flowers.

50
00:04:06,487 --> 00:04:07,855
And there's the small one.

51
00:04:07,988 --> 00:04:09,288
Can I see your tickets?

52
00:04:09,423 --> 00:04:11,859
Oh, good boy.

53
00:05:11,351 --> 00:05:13,887
Gina, Gina, Gina.

54
00:05:14,021 --> 00:05:15,689
The face
in the misty light.

55
00:05:15,822 --> 00:05:18,758
- Hello, Mr. Schwarz.
- Hello, Gina.

56
00:05:18,892 --> 00:05:22,897
I, uh... I have a meeting
with a very handsome cowboy man.

57
00:05:23,029 --> 00:05:25,031
He's waiting
for you in the bar.

58
00:05:25,765 --> 00:05:26,632
Ah.

59
00:05:26,767 --> 00:05:28,269
Well...

60
00:05:28,401 --> 00:05:30,137
since I just finished
watching

61
00:05:30,269 --> 00:05:32,438
a Rick Dalton
fucking film festival,

62
00:05:32,572 --> 00:05:35,241
I think I know who you are.
Put it there.

63
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:37,810
Well, it's my pleasure,
Mr. Schwartz.

64
00:05:37,945 --> 00:05:39,745
And thank you
for taking an interest.

65
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,415
<i>Schwarz,</i> not Schwartz.

66
00:05:41,548 --> 00:05:44,385
Ah. G-goddamn it to hell.
I'm-I'm sorry about that.

67
00:05:44,517 --> 00:05:47,587
- It's my pleasure, Mr. Schwarz.
- Call me Marvin.

68
00:05:47,721 --> 00:05:49,288
Marvin, call me Rick.

69
00:05:49,423 --> 00:05:50,725
- Rick?
- Yeah.

70
00:05:50,858 --> 00:05:52,860
- Oh, is that your son?
- My son?

71
00:05:52,993 --> 00:05:55,396
No, that's my stunt double,
Cliff Booth. Yeah.

72
00:05:55,529 --> 00:05:57,296
- Good to meet you.
- We've worked together

73
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:59,298
since the last two seasons
of <i>Bounty Law.</i>

74
00:05:59,433 --> 00:06:00,634
- Yeah?
- My car's in the shop,

75
00:06:00,767 --> 00:06:02,069
so he gave me a ride.

76
00:06:02,202 --> 00:06:03,771
<i>That's a big fucking lie.</i>

77
00:06:03,904 --> 00:06:05,738
<i>Rick got his driver's license
taken away</i>

78
00:06:05,873 --> 00:06:07,442
<i>for too many
drunk-driving tickets.</i>

79
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:09,010
<i>Cliff drives him
everywhere now.</i>

80
00:06:09,142 --> 00:06:10,276
Oh, fuck.

81
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:11,879
Well, sounds
like a good friend.

82
00:06:12,012 --> 00:06:13,947
- I try.
- Mm.

83
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,716
I wanna send you greetings
from my wife,

84
00:06:16,849 --> 00:06:18,752
Mary Alice <i>Schwarz.</i>

85
00:06:18,885 --> 00:06:21,288
Oh, well, that's nice.

86
00:06:23,024 --> 00:06:24,759
Thanks a lot.

87
00:06:26,592 --> 00:06:29,863
We had a Rick Dalton
double feature

88
00:06:29,997 --> 00:06:31,665
in our screening room
last night.

89
00:06:31,798 --> 00:06:35,969
Oh, well, that's both
flattering and-and embarrassing.

90
00:06:36,103 --> 00:06:37,672
What'd you see?

91
00:06:37,805 --> 00:06:40,674
Thirty-five mm prints
of <i>Tanner</i>

92
00:06:40,808 --> 00:06:43,110
and <i>The Fourteen Fists</i>
<i>of McCluskey.</i>

93
00:06:49,216 --> 00:06:52,586
I hope the, uh,
Rick Dalton double feature

94
00:06:52,719 --> 00:06:55,822
wasn't too painful for you
and the... And the missus.

95
00:06:55,955 --> 00:06:59,960
Oh, no. "Painful." Stop.
What are you saying?

96
00:07:01,594 --> 00:07:03,130
<i>Mary Alice loves Westerns.</i>

97
00:07:03,262 --> 00:07:05,132
<i>Our whole courtship,
we watched Westerns.</i>

98
00:07:05,264 --> 00:07:06,866
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

99
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,136
<i>And we thoroughly
enjoyed</i> Tanner.

100
00:07:09,269 --> 00:07:10,571
Oh, that's nice.

101
00:07:10,704 --> 00:07:12,840
It's really good.
And anyway, she goes to bed.

102
00:07:12,973 --> 00:07:16,009
<i>I open up a box of Havanas.</i>

103
00:07:16,142 --> 00:07:22,482
<i>I light up, I pour myself
a cognac and I watch...</i>

104
00:07:22,615 --> 00:07:25,051
<i>The Fourteen Fists
of McCluskey.</i>

105
00:07:25,185 --> 00:07:26,820
What a picture.

106
00:07:26,954 --> 00:07:28,689
- What a picture.
- Good picture, yeah.

107
00:07:28,822 --> 00:07:30,591
That is so much fun.

108
00:07:30,724 --> 00:07:31,724
All the shooting.

109
00:07:35,394 --> 00:07:37,430
I love that stuff.
You know, the killing.

110
00:07:37,563 --> 00:07:39,532
A lot of killing.
Lot of killing, yeah.

111
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:43,370
Now, gentlemen,
the plan is, we reverse our forces

112
00:07:43,502 --> 00:07:46,474
<i>und</i> drive the Allies
back into the sea!

113
00:07:49,342 --> 00:07:50,543
Genius.

114
00:07:50,676 --> 00:07:52,312
Panzer divisions come in,

115
00:07:52,445 --> 00:07:54,981
and we drive them here
to the ocean.

116
00:07:55,115 --> 00:07:56,483
They'll be up against
the wall.

117
00:07:56,615 --> 00:07:58,685
- They will have nowhere to go.
- Yes.

118
00:07:58,819 --> 00:08:01,022
This is the spot...

119
00:08:01,988 --> 00:08:03,389
Hermann!

120
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:06,427
Open the curtains.

121
00:08:26,212 --> 00:08:29,248
Anybody order
fried sauerkraut?

122
00:08:46,065 --> 00:08:49,569
Burn, you Nazi bastards!
Ha-ha-ha!

123
00:08:49,703 --> 00:08:53,574
That's you operating
the flamethrower, isn't it?

124
00:08:53,706 --> 00:08:55,608
Oh, you bet your sweet ass
it was. Yeah.

125
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:57,511
- It was you?
- Yeah. And let me tell you,

126
00:08:57,645 --> 00:08:59,680
that-that's one shit-fuck
crazy weapon

127
00:08:59,813 --> 00:09:01,982
y-y-you do not wanna be
on the wrong side of.

128
00:09:02,116 --> 00:09:03,484
Boy, oh, boy.

129
00:09:03,617 --> 00:09:06,386
You know, I practiced
with that dragon, uh,

130
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,288
three hours a day
for two weeks.

131
00:09:08,421 --> 00:09:10,156
Not just because
I wanted to look good

132
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:11,892
in the picture,
but because I was...

133
00:09:12,025 --> 00:09:14,127
I was shit-scared
of the thing, to be honest.

134
00:09:15,061 --> 00:09:16,662
Mike fucking Lewis!

135
00:09:16,796 --> 00:09:18,330
Crisping them Nazis
to hell!

136
00:09:18,464 --> 00:09:19,999
Oh, shit, that's...

137
00:09:20,132 --> 00:09:21,634
All right,
that's too hot.

138
00:09:21,768 --> 00:09:23,769
Anything we can do
about that heat?

139
00:09:23,903 --> 00:09:26,506
- Rick, it's a flamethrower.
- Yeah.

140
00:09:26,641 --> 00:09:29,843
So I came to the office
early today,

141
00:09:29,977 --> 00:09:35,516
and I watched two episodes
of <i>Bounty Law</i> on 16 mm.

142
00:09:35,648 --> 00:09:37,349
Jody Janice,

143
00:09:37,483 --> 00:09:39,853
wanted for cattle rustling
in the state of Wyoming,

144
00:09:39,987 --> 00:09:43,190
$425 dead or alive.

145
00:09:44,525 --> 00:09:46,793
And you brought him here
to collect.

146
00:09:46,926 --> 00:09:49,529
I don't even know
where here is.

147
00:09:49,662 --> 00:09:51,731
It was just
the closest place.

148
00:09:51,864 --> 00:09:54,667
Caught up with him about
five miles outside of town.

149
00:09:54,801 --> 00:09:56,736
So, bounty killer,

150
00:09:56,869 --> 00:10:00,240
the name of this town
is Janicetown.

151
00:10:02,542 --> 00:10:04,310
And that boy you killed...

152
00:10:04,444 --> 00:10:07,680
was Jody Janice.

153
00:10:07,814 --> 00:10:11,851
He was the baby boy
of Major Nathin Maxwell Janice.

154
00:10:11,984 --> 00:10:13,786
Hmm.

155
00:10:13,921 --> 00:10:17,791
Who's
Major Nathin Maxwell Janice?

156
00:10:17,924 --> 00:10:23,329
Well, I'll be sure
and introduce you

157
00:10:23,463 --> 00:10:25,565
when he gets here.

158
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:46,419

So, uh, you've been doing
guest shots

169
00:11:24,257 --> 00:11:26,926
on episodic TV shows
the last couple of years?

170
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:32,865
Yeah. Yeah. I'm doing a pilot
f-for CBS right now.

171
00:11:32,999 --> 00:11:35,434
It's called... It's called
<i>Lancer.</i> I play the heavy.

172
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:38,072
Did a, ahem,
Ron Ely <i>Tarzan.</i>

173
00:11:38,204 --> 00:11:41,108
I did a <i>Land of the Giants.</i>
<i>Green Hornet.</i>

174
00:11:41,241 --> 00:11:43,110
I did that show, uh...

175
00:11:43,243 --> 00:11:46,512
<i>Bingo Martin</i> with that kid
Scott Brown. Yeah.

176
00:11:46,647 --> 00:11:49,916
And I got a <i>F.B.I.</i>
that-that airs this Sunday.

177
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:53,620
You, um... You always play
the bad guy on these shows?

178
00:11:53,752 --> 00:11:56,455
- Y-yeah. Mm-hm.
- Yeah.

179
00:11:56,589 --> 00:11:59,358
So, and they have a fight scene
at the end of them?

180
00:11:59,492 --> 00:12:01,127
Well, not... Not...

181
00:12:01,261 --> 00:12:03,530
Not <i>Land of the Giants</i>
or <i>F.B.I.,</i>

182
00:12:03,662 --> 00:12:06,599
- but the rest, yeah. Yeah.
- And you lose in the fight?

183
00:12:06,733 --> 00:12:10,404
Yeah. Yeah, of course.
I'm... I'm the heavy.

184
00:12:10,536 --> 00:12:14,675
Oh, that's an old trick
pulled by the networks.

185
00:12:14,807 --> 00:12:16,676
Now, you take <i>Bingo Martin,</i>
for example.

186
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:18,310
- Mm-hm.
- Right?

187
00:12:18,445 --> 00:12:21,315
So you got a new guy
like Scott Brown.

188
00:12:21,448 --> 00:12:24,483
You wanna build up
his bona fides, right?

189
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:26,820
So you hire a guy
from a canceled show

190
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:28,488
- to play the heavy.
- Hmm.

191
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:31,757
Then at the end of the show,
when they fight,

192
00:12:31,892 --> 00:12:33,694
it's hero besting heavy.

193
00:12:33,826 --> 00:12:36,329
But what the audience sees

194
00:12:36,463 --> 00:12:41,334
is Bingo Martin
whipping Jake Cahill's ass.

195
00:12:41,468 --> 00:12:43,002
- Uh-huh.
- You see?

196
00:12:43,136 --> 00:12:46,406
Then next week,
it's Ron Ely.

197
00:12:46,539 --> 00:12:49,876
And next week,
it's Bob Conrad,

198
00:12:50,009 --> 00:12:52,912
wearing his tight pants,
kicking your ass.

199
00:12:53,046 --> 00:12:55,315
Yeah.

200
00:12:55,448 --> 00:12:57,983
Now, in another couple of years,
playing punching bag

201
00:12:58,118 --> 00:13:01,188
to every swinging dick
new to the network,

202
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,322
that's gonna have
a psychological effect

203
00:13:03,455 --> 00:13:06,859
on how the audience
perceives you.

204
00:13:06,993 --> 00:13:08,427
Right.

205
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,397
So, Rick,

206
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:13,334
who's gonna kick the shit
out of you next week?

207
00:13:13,467 --> 00:13:16,403
Mannix?
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.?

208
00:13:16,536 --> 00:13:18,470
The Girl from U.N.C.L.E.?

209
00:13:18,604 --> 00:13:20,807
How about
Batman and Robin?

210
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,541
Ping. Pow.

211
00:13:22,675 --> 00:13:24,545
Choom. Zoom.

212
00:13:26,647 --> 00:13:27,915
Down goes you.

213
00:13:28,047 --> 00:13:31,551
Down goes your career
as a leading man.

214
00:13:33,186 --> 00:13:39,325
Or do you go to Rome
and star in Westerns

215
00:13:39,459 --> 00:13:42,329
and win fucking fights?

216
00:13:48,868 --> 00:13:50,403
Ticket, señor?

217
00:13:58,078 --> 00:14:00,147
All right,
what's the matter, partner?

218
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,616
Well...

219
00:14:02,749 --> 00:14:06,285
it's official, old buddy.
I'm a has-been.

220
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,988
What are you talking about?
What did that guy tell you?

221
00:14:09,122 --> 00:14:11,458
He told me the goddamn truth,
is what he told me.

222
00:14:13,792 --> 00:14:15,762
- Oh. Whoa.
- Oh, shit.

223
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:17,564
- Hey.
- I'm sorry about that.

224
00:14:17,698 --> 00:14:18,565
Sorry about that.

225
00:14:18,699 --> 00:14:20,367
Here. Put these on.

226
00:14:20,499 --> 00:14:22,068
Don't cry
in front of the Mexicans.

227
00:14:22,201 --> 00:14:24,971
- Son of a bitch.
- What's got you so upset, man?

228
00:14:25,104 --> 00:14:27,373
Well, if coming face-to-face
with the failure

229
00:14:27,507 --> 00:14:29,575
that is your career
ain't worth crying about,

230
00:14:29,709 --> 00:14:31,310
then I don't know
what the fuck is.

231
00:14:31,445 --> 00:14:33,379
Right. That guy in there
turn you down?

232
00:14:33,512 --> 00:14:36,483
No. He wants to help me
get into Italian movies.

233
00:14:36,616 --> 00:14:38,318
Then what's the problem?

234
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:40,119
I gotta do
Italian goddamn movies!

235
00:14:40,253 --> 00:14:41,954
- That's the fucking problem!
- Come on.

236
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:45,059
Fucking bullshit! It doesn't
matter whether I cry in public.

237
00:14:45,191 --> 00:14:47,360
Nobody remembers
who the fuck I am anyway, huh?

238

Ten years of-of-of
treading water.

270
00:16:16,215 --> 00:16:20,219
And now a race
to the bottom. Heh.

271
00:16:20,353 --> 00:16:22,555
Look, I never had much
of a career to speak of,

272
00:16:22,689 --> 00:16:25,825
so I can't say I really know
how you feel.

273
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:28,328
What are you talking about?
You're my stunt double.

274
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,930
Come on, now. Shit.

275
00:16:30,063 --> 00:16:33,433
Rick, I'm your driver, man.
I'm-I'm your gofer.

276
00:16:33,565 --> 00:16:36,103
I'm not complaining, man.
I like driving you around.

277
00:16:36,235 --> 00:16:37,870
I like doing shit
around the house

278
00:16:38,003 --> 00:16:39,839
and house-sitting
in the Hollywood Hills

279
00:16:39,973 --> 00:16:42,275
when you're gone.

280
00:16:42,408 --> 00:16:44,210
But I haven't been
a full-time stuntman

281
00:16:44,344 --> 00:16:45,911
for a while now,

282
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:47,680
and from where I'm standing,

283
00:16:47,814 --> 00:16:49,916
going to Rome to star
in movies does not sound

284
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:52,886
like the fate worse than death
that you seem to think it is.

285
00:16:53,018 --> 00:16:57,222
Come on, now. You ever seen
an-an Italian Western, huh?

286
00:16:57,357 --> 00:16:59,425
They're awful.
It's a fucking farce.

287
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:02,060
Yeah, how many you seen?
One? Two?

288
00:17:02,195 --> 00:17:05,265
I've seen enough, all right?
Nobody likes Spaghetti Westerns.

289
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:03,991
Oh, hell, man,
stay in L.A.

290
00:18:04,123 --> 00:18:05,691
Give it what fer
next pilot season.

291
00:18:05,825 --> 00:18:07,960
Nah, nah. I'm... I'm...

292
00:18:08,094 --> 00:18:11,198
I'm too insecure now
to score come pilot season.

293
00:18:11,331 --> 00:18:14,168
Screen Gems ain't gonna have
nothing good to say about me.

294
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:16,202
- You know that.
- Shit. You made <i>Bounty Law.</i>

295
00:18:16,334 --> 00:18:18,537
Nobody's gonna forgive me
for that last season.

296
00:18:18,671 --> 00:18:20,073
- No matter what I do...
- Ah...

297
00:18:20,207 --> 00:18:22,007
...I'm always gonna be
the horse's ass

298
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:23,743
that got <i>Bounty Law</i> canceled

299
00:18:23,876 --> 00:18:27,646
because I wanted some fucking
rinky-dink movie career.

300
00:18:29,248 --> 00:18:32,117
- Tom. My friend.
- I met him?

301
00:18:32,251 --> 00:18:33,519
No, you haven't met him.

302
00:18:33,652 --> 00:18:35,488
You won't meet him
because I don't think

303
00:18:35,621 --> 00:18:36,523
- you'd like him.
- Why?

304
00:18:36,655 --> 00:18:38,157
Well...

305
00:18:40,325 --> 00:18:43,863
- Don't even joke.
- A joke? But they're scared.

306
00:18:58,074 --> 00:18:59,045
Holy shit. Heh.

307
00:18:59,178 --> 00:19:01,581
That was Polanski.

308
00:19:01,715 --> 00:19:03,216
That was Roman Polanski.

309
00:19:03,348 --> 00:19:05,584
He's lived there
for a month now.

310
00:19:05,719 --> 00:19:08,087
First time I seen him.
Ha-ha-ha.

311
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,190
Holy shit. Goddamn it.

312
00:19:13,325 --> 00:19:14,427
What do I always say?

313
00:19:14,561 --> 00:19:16,263
Most important thing
in this town is,

314
00:19:16,395 --> 00:19:18,731
when you're making money,
you buy a house in town.

315
00:19:18,864 --> 00:19:21,433
You don't rent.
Eddie O'Brien taught me that.

316
00:19:21,567 --> 00:19:23,636
Hollywood real estate
means you live here.

317
00:19:23,769 --> 00:19:27,172
You're not just visiting,
not just passing through.

318
00:19:27,306 --> 00:19:29,342
You fucking live here.

319
00:19:29,475 --> 00:19:31,044
Here I am flat
on my ass,

320
00:19:31,178 --> 00:19:33,213
and who I got living
next door to me?

321
00:19:33,345 --> 00:19:36,214
The director of <i>Rosemary's</i>
fucking <i>Baby,</i> that's who.

322
00:19:36,348 --> 00:19:38,617
Polanski, the hottest director
in town right now,

323
00:19:38,751 --> 00:19:40,018
probably the world.

324
00:19:40,152 --> 00:19:42,122
He's my next-door neighbor.

325
00:19:42,255 --> 00:19:45,190
I mean, shit. I mean,
who knows what could happen?

326
00:19:45,325 --> 00:19:47,861
I could... I could be
one pool party away

327
00:19:47,995 --> 00:19:49,896
f-from starring
in a new Polanski movie.

328
00:19:50,028 --> 00:19:51,363
So you're feeling better
now?

329
00:19:51,498 --> 00:19:53,266
Aw, yeah, yeah.
Sorry about all that.

330
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,067
Give me my glasses back.

331
00:19:55,201 --> 00:19:57,135
Oh, come get them, fucker.
Come...

332
00:19:57,269 --> 00:19:59,471
All right, all right,
Audie Murphy, relax.

333
00:19:59,605 --> 00:20:01,974
- There you go.
- You need me for anything else?

334
00:20:02,109 --> 00:20:04,944
Nah, nah, nah. I got a lot
of lines to learn for tomorrow.

335
00:20:05,076 --> 00:20:06,278
- Shit. All right.
- All right.

336
00:20:06,411 --> 00:20:07,913
I'm gonna get my carcass
on home.

337
00:20:08,046 --> 00:20:09,981
- All right.
- All right, 7:15 a.m.

338
00:20:10,115 --> 00:20:11,785
- Seven-fifteen.
- Out the door.

339
00:20:11,918 --> 00:20:13,253
- Out the door.
- In the car.

340
00:20:13,385 --> 00:20:14,420
All right,
see you then.

341
00:23:06,758 --> 00:23:09,627
Hello, coming in. Hello.

342
00:23:09,761 --> 00:23:11,630
Hello, darling. Hello.

343
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:13,934
Mm. Mm.

344
00:23:14,066 --> 00:23:15,701
Come here.

345
00:23:15,834 --> 00:23:17,836
Hello, sweetheart.

346
00:23:17,969 --> 00:23:21,274
Mm. How was your day?
Hmm?

347
00:23:21,408 --> 00:23:23,176
Wait till you see
what I got for you.

348
00:23:23,309 --> 00:23:26,611
Wait until you see
what I got for you.

349
00:23:26,746 --> 00:23:28,714
Look what I got for you.

350
00:23:28,847 --> 00:23:30,315
Gonna blow your mind, man.

351
00:23:34,487 --> 00:23:36,456
Come here. Come here.

352
00:23:38,658 --> 00:23:41,594
Ta, ta, ta. Oh!

353
00:24:41,487 --> 00:24:43,022
Was that a whine?

354
00:24:44,457 --> 00:24:45,991
What did I tell you
about whining?

355
00:24:46,124 --> 00:24:47,493
You whine, you don't eat.

356
00:24:47,626 --> 00:24:49,327
I will throw this shit
in the trash.

357
00:24:49,461 --> 00:24:50,863
I don't wanna, but I will.

358
00:24:52,297 --> 00:24:53,164
You understand?

359
00:24:53,298 --> 00:24:55,867
All right.

360
00:25:31,304 --> 00:25:33,773
<i>I waited at
the bar till closing time,</i>

361
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:36,442
<i>but he never came back.</i>

362
00:25:36,575 --> 00:25:38,844
<i>Okay, Peggy, what happened?</i>

363
00:25:38,978 --> 00:25:41,613
<i>I don't know.
Everything was fine.</i>

364
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:43,382
<i>We had dinner at my house.</i>

365
00:25:43,516 --> 00:25:44,950
<i>And afterwards, you know,</i>

366
00:25:45,084 --> 00:25:46,885
- <i>while I was doing the dishes,</i>
- Tsk, tsk.

367
00:25:47,019 --> 00:25:49,320
<i>he and Tobey played.</i>

368
00:25:49,455 --> 00:25:51,491
<i>And then, at the club,
Gabe was doing great.</i>

369
00:25:51,623 --> 00:25:53,726
<i>Then, wham, a sudden change.</i>

370
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:57,263
<i>You know how musicians are.
They're temperamental cats.</i>

371
00:25:57,396 --> 00:25:59,298
- <i>Who knows what got into him?</i>
- Yeah.

372
00:26:05,304 --> 00:26:09,675
<i>Rick Dalton rehearsal
tape starting in five, four,</i>

373
00:26:09,808 --> 00:26:12,377
<i>three, two, one.</i>

374
00:26:12,511 --> 00:26:16,815
Pepe, get your behind
behind that bar! I got a guest.

375
00:26:16,949 --> 00:26:18,383
<i>Johnny says...</i>

376
00:26:18,517 --> 00:26:21,554
<i>Spanish, Spanish, Spanish.</i>

377
00:26:21,688 --> 00:26:22,988
<i>How's the beans?</i>

378
00:26:23,122 --> 00:26:24,157
I've had worse.

379
00:26:25,857 --> 00:26:28,326
<i>Johnny says... Spanish.</i>

380
00:26:28,459 --> 00:26:29,961
<i>A toast.</i>

381
00:26:30,095 --> 00:26:32,463
To my wife
and all my sweethearts.

382
00:26:32,597 --> 00:26:35,166
May they never meet.

383
00:26:35,301 --> 00:26:37,803
Señor Madrid,
care to join me at my table

384
00:26:37,937 --> 00:26:40,805
where I entertain my guests?

385
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:44,009
<i>I would be
delighted, Monsieur Dakota.</i>

386
00:26:45,644 --> 00:26:48,381
Take the bottle with you.

387
00:26:48,514 --> 00:26:50,549
<i>And Pepe comes over.</i>

388
00:26:50,682 --> 00:26:53,018
Hey, where's that chili pepper
daughter of yours

389
00:26:53,151 --> 00:26:54,520
with the fiddle?

390
00:26:54,653 --> 00:26:56,488
<i>She's asleep.</i>

391
00:26:56,622 --> 00:26:58,690
Well, wake her the heck up,
get her down here

392
00:26:58,824 --> 00:27:01,861
with her fiddle and her bow,
and entertain my guests.

393
00:27:01,994 --> 00:27:04,530
<i>Sí, señor,
but please don't hurt her this time,</i>

394
00:27:04,663 --> 00:27:05,631
<i>I beg you.</i>

395
00:27:05,765 --> 00:27:07,232
I ain't gonna hurt her.

396
00:27:07,365 --> 00:27:09,134
Just want her
to play the fiddle.

397
00:27:09,267 --> 00:27:10,869
Fetch her and tell her
I'll give her

398
00:27:11,003 --> 00:27:12,238
a fat $5 gold piece,

399
00:27:12,372 --> 00:27:15,274
she play her little chili pepper
heart out.

400
00:27:15,407 --> 00:27:18,344
So, Johnny, what else
you heard about me?

401
00:27:18,478 --> 00:27:21,246
<i>I heard you're
pushing Lancer pretty hard,</i>

402
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:23,116
<i>but Lancer has money.</i>

403
00:27:23,248 --> 00:27:27,754
<i>At some point, he's gonna hire
some guns and push back.</i>

404
00:27:29,855 --> 00:27:31,257
- Oops, sorry.
- It's okay.

405
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:33,559
I'll open the door for you.

406
00:27:33,692 --> 00:27:35,294
You look good.

407
00:27:47,907 --> 00:27:49,509
I think Steve's
gonna be there too.

408
00:27:49,642 --> 00:27:50,610
Oh, yeah.

409
00:29:04,749 --> 00:29:06,819
Oh, look. They're here.

410
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,337
Welcome to the Playboy
Mansion, Mr. Polanski.

411
00:29:24,469 --> 00:29:27,472
Hey, how are you doing,
baby?

412
00:29:27,605 --> 00:29:30,375
Hey! Heh. How are you?

413
00:29:43,322 --> 00:29:45,558
Oh, Cass!

414
00:29:57,335 --> 00:29:59,072
Yeah!

415
00:30:04,543 --> 00:30:05,879
Yeah, baby!

416
00:30:08,646 --> 00:30:11,650
Yeah! Whoo! Whoo!

417
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,060
Oh, yeah.

418
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:57,863
I'm gonna tell you a story.

419
00:30:57,997 --> 00:31:00,733
She was engaged to him.

420
00:31:03,902 --> 00:31:09,976
Then she flew
to the UK...

421
00:31:10,109 --> 00:31:12,276
to make a film
with him,

422
00:31:12,411 --> 00:31:17,950
and broke off her engagement
with him and married him.

423
00:31:19,384 --> 00:31:23,088
Then they moved
to Los Angeles,

424
00:31:23,221 --> 00:31:25,289
and the three of them

425
00:31:25,423 --> 00:31:27,258
have been inseparable.

426
00:31:27,392 --> 00:31:29,629
Really?

427
00:31:31,162 --> 00:31:32,832
What's up?

428
00:31:34,499 --> 00:31:37,869
Jay loves Sharon,
that's what's up.

429
00:31:38,003 --> 00:31:41,040
- Mm.
- And he knows...

430
00:31:41,172 --> 00:31:44,443
as sure as God made
little green apples...

431
00:31:46,011 --> 00:31:48,013
that one of these days,
that Polish prick's

432
00:31:48,146 --> 00:31:49,448
gonna fuck things up,

433
00:31:49,582 --> 00:31:52,818
and when he does,
Jay's gonna be there.

434
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:55,187
Well, one thing's
for sure.

435
00:31:55,321 --> 00:31:56,988
Yeah?

436
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:58,323
What's that?

437
00:31:58,457 --> 00:32:01,960
Sharon absolutely has a type.

438
00:32:03,094 --> 00:32:05,331
Cute, short, talented guys

439
00:32:05,463 --> 00:32:08,267
who look
like 12-year-old boys.

440
00:32:08,401 --> 00:32:10,202
Yeah.

441
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,142
I never stood a chance.

442
00:32:54,345 --> 00:32:56,449
Argh. Fuck you,
Dr. Sapirstein.

443
00:33:41,058 --> 00:33:42,594
Oh, here we are.

444
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:49,501
Tell transpo!
Gonna need to move all that out!

445
00:33:49,634 --> 00:33:52,137
Just a sec. Hold on, guys.

446
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:53,138
Go ahead.

447
00:33:56,642 --> 00:33:58,510
You can talk to him.
Just talk to him.

448
00:33:58,643 --> 00:34:00,645
- Get that set in place.
- Hey.

449
00:34:00,778 --> 00:34:04,450
Ahem. I think the wind blew
down my TV antenna last night,

450
00:34:04,583 --> 00:34:07,286
so while I piss-fart
around with wardrobe,

451
00:34:07,419 --> 00:34:08,955
you mind going home
and fixing it?

452
00:34:09,087 --> 00:34:11,923
I can. You talk to
the stunt gaffer about me today?

453
00:34:12,056 --> 00:34:14,426
That way I'll know
if I'm working this week or not.

454
00:34:14,558 --> 00:34:16,727
Yeah. Ahem.
I've been meaning to tell you.

455
00:34:16,861 --> 00:34:20,965
The guy who gaffs this,
he's best friends with Randy,

456
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,634
the gaffer
from <i>The Green Hornet...</i>

457
00:34:22,768 --> 00:34:25,004
...so there ain't no point.

458
00:34:25,136 --> 00:34:27,506
If you don't need me,
I'll pick you up at wrap.

459
00:34:27,638 --> 00:34:29,841
I don't need you. Not today.

460
00:34:29,975 --> 00:34:33,812
Go home, fix my antenna,
do whatever. See you at wrap.

461
00:34:36,482 --> 00:34:38,550
Hey!

462
00:34:38,683 --> 00:34:41,853
You're Rick fucking Dalton.
Don't you forget it.

463
00:34:51,997 --> 00:34:53,132
Hey, hey.

464
00:34:53,265 --> 00:34:54,565
Hey, buddy,
I'm Rick Dalton.

465
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:56,234
You know
where I'm supposed to go?

466
00:34:56,368 --> 00:34:58,504
They're waiting for you
in the makeup trailer.

467
00:34:58,636 --> 00:35:00,339
Where's the makeup trailer?

468
00:35:00,471 --> 00:35:02,542
Straight back the way you came,
hard right.

469
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:09,549
Oh, my God.

470
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:16,721
Rick Dalton.

471
00:35:16,855 --> 00:35:18,122
Sam Wanamaker.

472
00:35:18,256 --> 00:35:19,724
Hey, Sam.

473
00:35:19,857 --> 00:35:20,993
Sorry about the wet hand.

474
00:35:21,127 --> 00:35:22,995
Oh, don't worry.
I'm used to it with Yul.

475
00:35:23,127 --> 00:35:25,529
I want you to know,
I'm the one who cast you.

476
00:35:25,663 --> 00:35:28,334
And I couldn't be more
delighted you're doing this.

477
00:35:28,466 --> 00:35:29,633
Oh, well, thank you, Sam.

478
00:35:29,768 --> 00:35:32,204
I... I appreciate it.
It's a good part.

479
00:35:32,337 --> 00:35:35,240
Yeah, it is. Have you met
Jim Stacy, the series lead?

480
00:35:35,373 --> 00:35:36,676
Uh, not yet, no. No.

481
00:35:36,808 --> 00:35:39,544
Well, you guys are going
to be dynamite together.

482
00:35:39,678 --> 00:35:40,613
Mm. Mm.

483
00:35:40,745 --> 00:35:43,047
Well, it sounds exciting.

484
00:35:43,181 --> 00:35:45,216
- Yeah, lightning in a bottle.
- Mm.

485
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:47,453
Now, you met Sonya,
makeup and hair?

486
00:35:47,585 --> 00:35:48,752
Hi.

487
00:35:48,886 --> 00:35:50,855
And this is Rebekka,
who does costumes.

488
00:35:50,989 --> 00:35:52,390
Hello.

489
00:35:52,524 --> 00:35:53,859
- Hi.
- Howdy.

490
00:35:53,991 --> 00:35:55,727
I want a whole
new look for Caleb.

491
00:35:55,861 --> 00:35:57,395
I don't want this
Western costumed

492
00:35:57,529 --> 00:35:59,131
the way they costumed
<i>The Big Valley</i>

493
00:35:59,263 --> 00:36:00,966
and <i>Bonanza</i>
for the last decade.

494
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:03,703
I want a zeitgeist flair
to the costumes.

495
00:36:05,337 --> 00:36:06,771
I mean,
nothing anachronistic,

496
00:36:06,904 --> 00:36:11,109
but where does 1869
and 1969 meet?

497
00:36:11,243 --> 00:36:13,777
Especially when it comes
to you, Caleb.

498
00:36:13,911 --> 00:36:15,247
Mm. Mm.

499
00:36:15,379 --> 00:36:17,248
First off,
I want to give him a mustache.

500
00:36:17,381 --> 00:36:21,953
A big, droopy,
Zapata-like mustache.

501
00:36:22,087 --> 00:36:24,089
Now, about his jacket.

502
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:25,958
I want to give him
a hippie jacket.

503
00:36:26,091 --> 00:36:28,460
Something he could wear
into the London Fog tonight

504
00:36:28,593 --> 00:36:30,562
and look like the hippest guy
in the room.

505
00:36:30,696 --> 00:36:32,864
Far out.
We got a Custer jacket.

506
00:36:32,997 --> 00:36:34,565
Fringes all down the arm.

507
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:37,468
It's tan now,
but I dye it dark brown,

508
00:36:37,602 --> 00:36:39,571
he could hit the Strip in it
tonight.

509
00:36:39,705 --> 00:36:41,672
That's my girl. Heh.

510
00:36:41,806 --> 00:36:44,643
- Now, Rick, about your hair.
- What about my hair?

511
00:36:44,776 --> 00:36:46,611
I want to go
with a different hairstyle.

512
00:36:46,745 --> 00:36:47,779
Huh. What?

513
00:36:47,913 --> 00:36:50,516
Something
more hippie-ish.

514
00:36:50,649 --> 00:36:53,918
You want me
to look like a hippie?

515
00:36:54,053 --> 00:36:57,022
Well, think less hippie,
more...

516
00:36:57,154 --> 00:36:58,189
Hells Angel!

517
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,761
- Right. Say, Sam...
- Get me the...

518
00:37:02,893 --> 00:37:05,663
Sam. Sam, uh...

519
00:37:05,797 --> 00:37:07,665
if you got me covered up
in all this...

520
00:37:07,799 --> 00:37:10,100
this junk, uh,

521
00:37:10,234 --> 00:37:12,003
how's the audience
gonna know it's me?

522
00:37:13,103 --> 00:37:14,172
I hope they don't.

523
00:37:14,306 --> 00:37:15,507
Mm.

524
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:20,011
I don't want them to see
Jake Cahill.

525
00:37:20,145 --> 00:37:22,980
I want them to see Caleb.

526
00:37:23,114 --> 00:37:25,917
I hired you
to be an actor, Rick.

527
00:37:26,051 --> 00:37:29,188
Not a TV cowboy.
You're better than that.

528
00:40:40,812 --> 00:40:44,549
<i>I've been meaning to tell
you, the guy who gaffs this,</i>

529
00:40:44,683 --> 00:40:46,051
<i>he's best friends
with Randy,</i>

530
00:40:46,183 --> 00:40:47,718
<i>the gaffer</i>
<i>from</i> The Green Hornet,

531
00:40:47,852 --> 00:40:50,188
<i>so there really
ain't no point.</i>

532
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:06,772
Hey, Randy.

533
00:41:09,174 --> 00:41:11,076
Cliff.

534
00:41:11,209 --> 00:41:13,511
So you're still with Rick,
huh?

535
00:41:13,645 --> 00:41:14,547
Still here.

536
00:41:16,047 --> 00:41:16,915
He in there?

537
00:41:17,049 --> 00:41:19,084
Yeah. Just knock.

538
00:41:23,455 --> 00:41:26,257
Look, just put him
in the wardrobe, all right?

539
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:27,491
What's it gonna hurt?

540
00:41:27,625 --> 00:41:29,227
Then if you need him,
you got him.

541
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:30,996
But then I gotta have
a conversation

542
00:41:31,129 --> 00:41:32,697
with that
wardrobe assistant,

543
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:35,599
- and, man, she's a fucking bitch.
- I just don't... Please, I...

544
00:41:35,734 --> 00:41:38,502
Look, Randy, I'm asking you
to help me out, man.

545
00:41:38,636 --> 00:41:40,339
If the answer's no,
the answer's no,

546
00:41:40,471 --> 00:41:42,940
not no with excuses.

547
00:41:43,073 --> 00:41:45,342
Hey, man.

548
00:41:45,475 --> 00:41:48,546
This ain't a fucking
Andy McLaglen picture, you know?

549
00:41:48,681 --> 00:41:51,416
I can't afford to hire a bunch
of guys to smoke cigarettes

550
00:41:51,549 --> 00:41:53,585
and sit around talking
to each other all day

551
00:41:53,718 --> 00:41:55,319
on the chance
that I might use them.

552
00:41:55,453 --> 00:41:56,955
I got a four-man team here,
Rick.

553
00:41:57,087 --> 00:41:59,423
If I need more than that,
I gotta get it approved.

554
00:41:59,558 --> 00:42:01,993
And, you know,
I gotta look after my dudes.

555
00:42:02,127 --> 00:42:04,996
Hey, and if your dudes
were a better match for me,

556
00:42:05,129 --> 00:42:06,564
I'd say, "Okay, you got me,"

557
00:42:06,698 --> 00:42:09,267
but-but that's not the case,
and you know it.

558
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:11,469
- He's a great match for me.
- Yeah, no...

559
00:42:11,602 --> 00:42:13,604
Hey, you could do
anything you want to him.

560
00:42:13,738 --> 00:42:16,808
Throw him off a building, right?
Light him on fire.

561
00:42:16,942 --> 00:42:18,744
Hit him with
a fucking Lincoln, right?

562
00:42:18,877 --> 00:42:20,445
Get creative.
Do whatever you want.

563
00:42:20,578 --> 00:42:22,247
He's just happy
for the opportunity.

564
00:42:22,379 --> 00:42:24,415
- Rick.
- Yeah?

565
00:42:26,584 --> 00:42:28,486
I don't dig him.

566
00:42:30,122 --> 00:42:33,457
And I don't dig the vibe
he brings on a set.

567
00:42:33,591 --> 00:42:36,228
What, is there some old beef
between the two of you?

568
00:42:36,361 --> 00:42:38,629
- Oh, come on, man.
- What? What?

569
00:42:38,763 --> 00:42:40,966
The dude killed
his fucking wife.

570
00:42:42,933 --> 00:42:46,238
Come on, man. You don't believe
that old shit, do you?

571
00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:47,972
Yes, Rick, I do.

572
00:42:48,105 --> 00:42:51,142
And I work with my wife,
and she believes it.

573
00:42:51,276 --> 00:42:53,444
She doesn't want
his creepy ass around.

574
00:42:55,781 --> 00:42:57,315
You know, this is probably

575
00:42:57,448 --> 00:42:59,651
the shittiest weather ever.

576
00:42:59,785 --> 00:43:02,886
The shittiest weather
on the shittiest boat

577
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:04,522
with the shittiest person.

578
00:43:06,424 --> 00:43:09,827
Natalie, my sister, said,
"He's a loser. He's a loser."

579
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:11,896
They all said it,
"He's a fucking loser,"

580
00:43:12,029 --> 00:43:13,297
and I didn't believe them.

581
00:43:13,431 --> 00:43:16,368
So I guess
I'm the fucking idiot.

582
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:18,136
And now you're not
gonna talk to me?

583
00:43:18,268 --> 00:43:20,537
What, you don't feel
like fighting?

584
00:43:20,672 --> 00:43:22,307
Well, I feel like
fucking fighting

585
00:43:22,439 --> 00:43:24,508
because I've been up here
by myself

586
00:43:24,643 --> 00:43:28,213
for four hours on this
fucking shithole of a boat.

587
00:43:28,346 --> 00:43:29,982
Yeah.

588
00:43:32,017 --> 00:43:35,319
H-he's a goddamn
war hero. Fuck.

589
00:43:37,654 --> 00:43:38,857
Yeah, appreciate it.

590
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:48,167
Okay, you fucking horse's ass.
Let's get you over to wardrobe.

591
00:43:50,835 --> 00:43:52,771
Now, I'll put you
in wardrobe,

592
00:43:52,904 --> 00:43:55,507
but you don't stunt,
I don't pay you.

593
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:58,544
Appreciate the opportunity,
Randy. I won't let you down.

594
00:43:58,676 --> 00:44:01,345
You know my wife Janet,
don't you?

595
00:44:01,478 --> 00:44:02,846
Yeah.

596
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:05,183
Steer clear of her.

597
00:44:05,317 --> 00:44:08,520
Now, I admire
Cassius Clay, I do.

598
00:44:08,654 --> 00:44:10,889
What I admire is,
in his sport,

599
00:44:11,022 --> 00:44:13,257
there's an element
of true combat.

600
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:15,927
When Cassius Clay meets
Sonny Liston in the ring,

601
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:18,263
that's not two athletes
posturing.

602
00:44:18,397 --> 00:44:20,265
That's combat.

603
00:44:20,399 --> 00:44:23,567
Two men trying to kill
each other right now.

604
00:44:23,701 --> 00:44:25,736
If you don't beat him...

605
00:44:25,870 --> 00:44:27,939
he kills you.

606
00:44:28,073 --> 00:44:29,674
That's beyond athletics.

607
00:44:29,808 --> 00:44:33,378
That's beyond
<i>Wide World of Sports,</i> you know?

608
00:44:33,511 --> 00:44:35,379
That's two warriors
engaged in combat.

609
00:44:35,513 --> 00:44:37,949
That's what I admire.

610
00:44:38,082 --> 00:44:39,417
In martial arts tournaments,

611
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:41,119
they won't let you fight
like that.

612
00:44:41,252 --> 00:44:43,254
It's very frustrating.

613
00:44:43,388 --> 00:44:44,689
You stand in front of a guy,

614
00:44:44,823 --> 00:44:47,625
and you just wanna let him
have it. Ha!

615
00:44:47,759 --> 00:44:49,294
But you can't.

616
00:44:49,426 --> 00:44:53,363
So you gotta do this
playacting, patty-cake version.

617
00:44:53,497 --> 00:44:56,600
Cassius Clay. Sonny Liston.
Joe Louis.

618
00:44:56,734 --> 00:44:57,803
The colored boxer,

619
00:44:57,935 --> 00:44:59,604
not that white
kickboxing asshole.

620
00:45:00,939 --> 00:45:03,642
They do what
they need to do to win.

621
00:45:03,774 --> 00:45:05,676
They unleash
as much punishment

622
00:45:05,810 --> 00:45:08,146
as they have to
to defeat the other guy.

623
00:45:09,314 --> 00:45:10,949
But in martial arts
tournaments,

624
00:45:11,082 --> 00:45:13,451
I do to win what
they do to win.

625
00:45:13,585 --> 00:45:16,488
I unleash all my power.

626
00:45:17,254 --> 00:45:18,922
I kill people.

627
00:45:19,056 --> 00:45:21,160
If you fought Cassius
Clay, who would win?

628
00:45:21,292 --> 00:45:23,961
Well,
that would never happen.

629
00:45:24,094 --> 00:45:26,598
But if you did,
what do you think would happen?

630
00:45:27,799 --> 00:45:29,134
I'd make him a cripple.

631
00:45:32,437 --> 00:45:35,272
Hey, you. What's your name?

632
00:45:35,406 --> 00:45:37,809
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

633
00:45:39,109 --> 00:45:40,644
My name's Cliff.

634
00:45:40,779 --> 00:45:42,781
I'm Rick Dalton's
stunt double.

635
00:45:42,913 --> 00:45:45,517
- Stuntman?
- Yeah.

636
00:45:45,649 --> 00:45:48,151
You know,
you're kind of pretty for a stuntman.

637
00:45:48,285 --> 00:45:50,021
That's what they tell me.

638
00:45:50,154 --> 00:45:54,024
So did I say something
funny, stuntman?

639
00:45:54,158 --> 00:45:57,194
- Yeah, you kind of did.
- What's so funny?

640
00:45:57,328 --> 00:45:59,330
Look, man,
I don't want any trouble.

641
00:45:59,464 --> 00:46:00,864
I'm just here
to do a job.

642
00:46:00,998 --> 00:46:02,801
But you're laughing at
what I'm saying.

643
00:46:02,933 --> 00:46:04,468
But I'm not saying
anything funny.

644
00:46:04,602 --> 00:46:06,904
So, what do you think
is so funny?

645
00:46:08,205 --> 00:46:10,341
What I think is...

646
00:46:12,542 --> 00:46:15,078
you're a little man
with a big mouth and a big chip,

647
00:46:15,212 --> 00:46:16,915
and I think you
should be embarrassed

648
00:46:17,047 --> 00:46:19,183
to suggest you'd be
anything more than a stain

649
00:46:19,317 --> 00:46:22,086
on the seat
of Cassius Clay's trunks.

650
00:46:22,219 --> 00:46:25,055
Brother, you're the one
with the big mouth.

651
00:46:25,189 --> 00:46:26,857
And I would really
enjoy closing it,

652
00:46:26,991 --> 00:46:29,993
especially in front
of all my friends.

653
00:46:30,127 --> 00:46:33,464
But my hands are registered
as lethal weapons.

654
00:46:33,598 --> 00:46:35,866
That means,
we get into a fight,

655
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,903
I accidentally kill you,
I go to jail.

656
00:46:40,038 --> 00:46:41,639
Anybody accidentally
kills anybody

657
00:46:41,772 --> 00:46:43,040
in a fight,
they go to jail.

658
00:46:43,174 --> 00:46:44,576
It's called
manslaughter.

659
00:46:44,709 --> 00:46:46,844
And I think all that
"lethal weapon" horseshit

660
00:46:46,977 --> 00:46:48,479
is just an excuse
so you dancers

661
00:46:48,613 --> 00:46:50,748
never have to get
in a real fight.

662
00:46:51,982 --> 00:46:52,884
Okay.

663
00:46:54,118 --> 00:46:55,921
How about
a friendly contest?

664
00:46:57,154 --> 00:46:59,056
No punching in the face.

665
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:00,725
Two out of three.

666
00:47:00,859 --> 00:47:02,860
Who puts who
on the ground first?

667
00:47:02,993 --> 00:47:07,865
Nobody tries to hurt nobody,
just who ends up on their butt?

668
00:47:11,669 --> 00:47:14,138
That's a great idea, Kato.

669
00:47:25,783 --> 00:47:27,785
You know, Bruce,
that guy's kind of famous.

670
00:47:27,919 --> 00:47:29,421
That guy?

671
00:47:29,553 --> 00:47:30,921
For what?

672
00:47:31,056 --> 00:47:33,425
Killed his wife
and got away with it.

673
00:47:33,558 --> 00:47:34,693
That guy?

674
00:47:34,826 --> 00:47:36,361
That guy.

675
00:48:00,951 --> 00:48:02,286
Not bad, Kato.

676
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:05,423
Try that again.

677
00:48:46,497 --> 00:48:48,832
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

678
00:48:48,966 --> 00:48:50,701
What the fuck
is going on here?

679
00:48:50,835 --> 00:48:53,939
Hey, jackass,
this is our series lead.

680
00:48:54,071 --> 00:48:55,640
What the fuck
are you thinking?

681
00:48:55,772 --> 00:48:57,975
You're right, Janet.
I'm sorry about that.

682
00:48:58,109 --> 00:49:00,678
Don't fucking "Janet" me,
you prick.

683
00:49:00,812 --> 00:49:03,014
Hey.
What's up, babe?

684
00:49:03,147 --> 00:49:06,484
What's up, Randy,
is that your loser asshole,

685
00:49:06,616 --> 00:49:09,821
wife-killing buddy boy here was
beating the shit out of Bruce.

686
00:49:09,953 --> 00:49:11,354
What?

687
00:49:11,489 --> 00:49:13,492
- Hey, Randy.
- Cliff.

688
00:49:13,625 --> 00:49:15,360
What the fuck, man?

689
00:49:15,493 --> 00:49:18,930
Let me just say, nobody beat
the shit out of Bruce.

690
00:49:19,064 --> 00:49:21,332
It was a friendly contest.
He barely touched me.

691
00:49:21,466 --> 00:49:24,036
I think that dent in the car
says something different.

692
00:49:25,703 --> 00:49:27,906
Oh, my God!

693
00:49:28,038 --> 00:49:30,440
What the fuck
did you do to my car?!

694
00:49:30,575 --> 00:49:32,710
What the fuck
did you do to her car?

695
00:49:32,843 --> 00:49:34,812
I threw this
little prick into it,

696
00:49:34,946 --> 00:49:36,881
but I did not know
it was her car.

697
00:49:37,013 --> 00:49:41,484
Get the wardrobe off,
get your shit, and get fucked!

698
00:49:41,618 --> 00:49:42,553
- Janet!
- What?

699
00:49:42,687 --> 00:49:43,755
I will handle this.

700
00:49:43,888 --> 00:49:45,489
Then fucking handle it,
Randy.

701
00:49:46,991 --> 00:49:47,893
Cliff...

702
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:52,263
get the wardrobe off,
get your shit,

703
00:49:52,397 --> 00:49:54,099
and get off the lot.

704
00:49:57,134 --> 00:49:58,536
Fair enough.

705
00:50:32,803 --> 00:50:35,238
Aw. What's the matter?

706
00:50:35,372 --> 00:50:39,209
Are you afraid I'll tell
Jim Morrison you were dancing

707
00:50:39,343 --> 00:50:41,645
to Paul Revere
and the Raiders?

708
00:50:41,779 --> 00:50:43,648
Are they not
cool enough for you?

709
00:50:53,256 --> 00:50:55,759
Who's this
shaggy asshole?

710
00:50:57,460 --> 00:50:58,796
Hello? Can I help you?

711
00:50:58,928 --> 00:51:01,631
Oh, yeah. Hey, man.
I'm looking for Terry.

712
00:51:01,765 --> 00:51:04,801
I'm a friend of Terry's
and Dennis Wilson's.

713
00:51:04,935 --> 00:51:07,072
Well, Terry and Candy
don't live here anymore.

714
00:51:07,205 --> 00:51:08,806
This is the Polanski
residence now.

715
00:51:08,939 --> 00:51:11,276
Really? He moved?

716
00:51:11,908 --> 00:51:12,810
Dang.

717
00:51:14,145 --> 00:51:15,979
Uh, you know...?
You know where?

718
00:51:16,114 --> 00:51:18,382
I'm not sure,
but the owner of the property,

719
00:51:18,517 --> 00:51:21,386
Paul, might.
He's in the guest house.

720
00:51:21,518 --> 00:51:22,986
Who is it, Jay?

721
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:26,557
It's okay, honey.
It's a friend of Terry's.

722
00:51:26,690 --> 00:51:28,792
Yeah, just take
the back path.

723
00:51:28,926 --> 00:51:30,061
Thank you kindly.

724
00:51:32,196 --> 00:51:33,531
Ma'am.

725
00:51:49,413 --> 00:51:51,682
- All right, that's an hour!
- Hey, Rick.

726
00:51:51,815 --> 00:51:53,384
I know they just
broke for lunch,

727
00:51:53,518 --> 00:51:56,220
but you need to wait at least
an hour before you can eat.

728
00:51:56,353 --> 00:51:59,022
- Give that glue a chance to dry.
- Oh, no worries, honey.

729
00:51:59,156 --> 00:52:03,460
I got my book. Say, say,
where's the bad-guy saloon?

730
00:52:03,593 --> 00:52:05,696
You just go straight
through the Western town,

731
00:52:05,830 --> 00:52:08,299
take a right and a left,
and you see it right there.

732
00:52:08,433 --> 00:52:11,035
Thanks, honey.

733
00:52:12,404 --> 00:52:14,406
Can we move to number two?

734
00:52:14,538 --> 00:52:16,006
How is his bounce?

735
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:17,740
Can I get a bounce there?

736
00:52:17,875 --> 00:52:20,377
Just grab the crescent
wrench, come right back.

737
00:52:20,511 --> 00:52:21,713
Just make it a quick one.

738
00:52:23,047 --> 00:52:25,584
- Tim!
- Looks great. Right there.

739
00:53:11,261 --> 00:53:12,596
Hello.

740
00:53:14,931 --> 00:53:15,834
Hello.

741
00:53:18,602 --> 00:53:19,937
Hello.

742
00:53:22,107 --> 00:53:23,306
Would...

743
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:25,142
Would it bother you
if I sat

744
00:53:25,276 --> 00:53:27,279
next to you
and read my book too?

745
00:53:29,614 --> 00:53:31,149
I don't know.

746
00:53:32,082 --> 00:53:34,151
Would you bother me?

747
00:53:34,285 --> 00:53:35,754
I'll try not to.

748
00:53:39,156 --> 00:53:40,292
Sit.

749
00:54:25,303 --> 00:54:26,304
Ah.

750
00:54:27,538 --> 00:54:31,375
Sorry. Sorry about that.
Ahem.

751
00:54:36,714 --> 00:54:37,982
You don't eat lunch?

752
00:54:39,350 --> 00:54:41,518
I've got a scene
after lunch.

753
00:54:41,652 --> 00:54:42,654
Yeah?

754
00:54:44,288 --> 00:54:47,558
Eating lunch before I do
a scene makes me sluggish.

755
00:54:47,692 --> 00:54:49,493
I believe it's the job
of an actor...

756
00:54:49,627 --> 00:54:51,728
And I say "actor,"
not "actress,"

757
00:54:51,863 --> 00:54:54,665
because the word "actress"
is nonsensical.

758
00:54:54,799 --> 00:54:57,035
It's the actor's job
to avoid

759
00:54:57,167 --> 00:54:59,202
impediments
to their performance.

760
00:54:59,335 --> 00:55:03,908
It's the actor's job to strive
for 100 percent effectiveness.

761
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:08,145
Naturally, we never succeed,
but it's the pursuit...

762
00:55:08,946 --> 00:55:10,381
that's meaningful.

763
00:55:11,783 --> 00:55:14,485
- Who are you?
- You can call me Marabella.

764
00:55:14,618 --> 00:55:17,520
Mar... Marabella what?

765
00:55:17,654 --> 00:55:19,122
Marabella Lancer.

766
00:55:19,256 --> 00:55:22,526
No, no, come on, come on.
What's your real name?

767
00:55:24,661 --> 00:55:26,631
When we're on set,
I'd prefer to only

768
00:55:26,763 --> 00:55:28,698
be referred to
by my character's name.

769
00:55:28,832 --> 00:55:31,935
It helps me invest
in the reality of the story.

770
00:55:32,069 --> 00:55:34,238
I've tried it both ways,
and I'm always just

771
00:55:34,372 --> 00:55:36,574
a tiny bit better
when I don't break character.

772
00:55:36,707 --> 00:55:40,245
And if I can be
a tiny bit better, I want to be.

773
00:55:43,446 --> 00:55:46,417
You're the bad guy.
Caleb DeCoteau.

774
00:55:50,087 --> 00:55:53,391
I thought it was
pronounced Caleb "Dakota."

775
00:55:53,524 --> 00:55:56,627
I'm pretty sure
it's "DeCoteau."

776
00:55:58,930 --> 00:56:00,732
- DeCoteau.
- Mm.

777
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:05,035
DeCoteau. DeCoteau.

778
00:56:06,270 --> 00:56:07,605
Hmm.

779
00:56:22,953 --> 00:56:24,288
What are you reading?

780
00:56:25,622 --> 00:56:28,091
It's a biography
on Walt Disney.

781
00:56:28,225 --> 00:56:29,792
It's fascinating.

782
00:56:29,926 --> 00:56:31,762
He's a genius, you know.

783
00:56:31,895 --> 00:56:35,265
I mean, a once-in-every-50
-or-100-years kind of genius.

784
00:56:35,399 --> 00:56:37,469
What are you, 12?

785
00:56:38,335 --> 00:56:39,504
I'm 8.

786
00:56:40,404 --> 00:56:42,172
What are you reading?

787
00:56:43,741 --> 00:56:44,976
Just a Western.

788
00:56:45,109 --> 00:56:48,045
What does that mean?
Is it good?

789
00:56:48,178 --> 00:56:51,149
- Pretty good.
- What's the story?

790
00:56:52,582 --> 00:56:54,285
I haven't finished
it yet.

791
00:56:54,417 --> 00:56:57,520
I didn't ask
for the whole story.

792
00:56:57,654 --> 00:56:59,357
What's the idea
of the story?

793
00:57:00,792 --> 00:57:02,259
Well... ahem,

794
00:57:02,393 --> 00:57:05,463
it's about this guy
who's a bronco buster.

795
00:57:06,663 --> 00:57:08,632
It's the story
of his life.

796
00:57:09,966 --> 00:57:11,768
Guy's name
is Tom Breezy,

797
00:57:11,902 --> 00:57:14,939
but everyone always
calls him Easy Breezy.

798
00:57:15,071 --> 00:57:17,642
Now, when Easy Breezy
was in his 20s

799
00:57:17,774 --> 00:57:20,777
and-and-and young and
good-looking, he could...

800
00:57:20,910 --> 00:57:24,147
He could break any horse
that you could throw at him.

801
00:57:24,281 --> 00:57:27,183
Back then,
he just had a way.

802
00:57:27,317 --> 00:57:30,587
Now he's into
his, uh, late 30s

803
00:57:30,721 --> 00:57:33,324
and he takes a bad fall,
and it messes up his hip.

804
00:57:33,457 --> 00:57:35,859
He's not... He's not...
He's not crippled

805
00:57:35,993 --> 00:57:38,328
or anything like that, but...

806
00:57:38,462 --> 00:57:40,431
But he's got
spine problems

807
00:57:40,564 --> 00:57:43,233
he never had before,
and he spends, uh...

808
00:57:44,734 --> 00:57:48,404
more of his days in pain
than he ever did before.

809
00:57:48,538 --> 00:57:51,441
Jeepers, this sounds
like a good novel.

810
00:57:52,375 --> 00:57:54,211
Yeah, it's not bad.

811
00:57:55,212 --> 00:57:56,914
Where are you in it?

812
00:57:57,047 --> 00:57:59,250
Mm. About midway.

813
00:58:00,618 --> 00:58:03,821
What's happening
to Easy Breezy now?

814
00:58:03,955 --> 00:58:06,424
Uh, he's, um...
He...

815
00:58:07,825 --> 00:58:09,593
He's not the best
anymore.

816
00:58:10,861 --> 00:58:12,729
In fact,
far from it. And...

817
00:58:14,631 --> 00:58:18,569
he's coming to terms with what
it's like to be slightly more...

818
00:58:21,372 --> 00:58:22,906
use...

819
00:58:30,681 --> 00:58:34,953
Slightly more useless
each day.

820
00:58:50,433 --> 00:58:52,303
I-it's okay, Caleb.

821
00:58:52,435 --> 00:58:53,970
It's okay.

822
00:58:54,105 --> 00:58:56,540
It sounds like
a really sad book.

823
00:58:56,672 --> 00:58:58,575
Poor Easy Breezy.

824
00:58:58,709 --> 00:59:01,145
I'm practically crying,
and I haven't even read it.

825
00:59:03,214 --> 00:59:05,116
About 15 years,
you'll be living it.

826
00:59:05,248 --> 00:59:06,551
What?

827
00:59:09,919 --> 00:59:12,656
Nothing, pumpkin puss.
I'm just...

828
00:59:13,723 --> 00:59:15,158
I'm just teasing you.

829
00:59:16,527 --> 00:59:18,329
You know something? You...

830
00:59:19,730 --> 00:59:22,498
You might be right
about this book.

831
00:59:22,632 --> 00:59:25,837
I think it hits harder
than I gave it credit for.

832
00:59:27,672 --> 00:59:30,975
I don't like names
like "pumpkin puss,"

833
00:59:31,975 --> 00:59:33,943
but since you're upset,

834
00:59:34,078 --> 00:59:36,014
we'll talk about that
some other time.

835
01:00:30,634 --> 01:00:33,036
I'm only going as far
as Westwood Village.

836
01:00:33,169 --> 01:00:34,837
Hey, beggars
can't be choosers.

837
01:00:34,971 --> 01:00:35,872
- Come on in.
- Thanks.

838
01:00:56,493 --> 01:00:58,129
- Thank you so much.
- My pleasure.

839
01:00:59,529 --> 01:01:01,332
- Good luck on your adventure.
- Thank you.

840
01:01:01,464 --> 01:01:03,834
- Have a good time in Big Sur.
- Thank you so much.

841
01:01:03,966 --> 01:01:05,169
- Take care.
- You too.

842
01:02:11,569 --> 01:02:14,105
- Oh, hey.
- Hello.

843
01:02:14,238 --> 01:02:16,806
How can I help you,
young lady?

844
01:02:16,939 --> 01:02:19,175
Oh.

845
01:02:19,308 --> 01:02:21,011
I'm here to pick up
a first edition

846
01:02:21,145 --> 01:02:23,681
of Thomas Hardy's <i>Tess</i>
<i>of the d'Urbervilles</i> I ordered.

847
01:02:23,814 --> 01:02:24,980
It's under Polanski.

848
01:02:25,114 --> 01:02:26,850
Yeah, you're talking books
there, kid.

849
01:02:26,984 --> 01:02:28,352
Oh, I know.
Isn't it wonderful?

850
01:02:28,484 --> 01:02:30,353
- Yeah. Oh, man.
- I just read it.

851
01:02:30,488 --> 01:02:32,823
- I'm getting it as a gift for my husband.
- Mm.

852
01:02:35,625 --> 01:02:38,127
- Rick Dalton?
- You bet.

853
01:02:38,261 --> 01:02:40,797
Jim Stacy. This is my show.
Welcome aboard.

854
01:02:40,931 --> 01:02:42,665
We're real glad
to have a pro like you

855
01:02:42,799 --> 01:02:44,200
playing the heavy
on the pilot.

856
01:02:44,334 --> 01:02:46,703
And I gotta tell you,
I came damn close

857
01:02:46,837 --> 01:02:49,506
to being in <i>The Fourteen</i>
<i>Fists of McCluskey.</i>

858
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:50,808
- No kidding.
- Yeah.

859
01:02:50,940 --> 01:02:52,509
Let me tell you, I...

860
01:02:52,643 --> 01:02:54,845
I just got my part-part
by sheer luck.

861
01:02:54,977 --> 01:02:56,645
Up until two weeks
before shooting,

862
01:02:56,779 --> 01:02:58,415
Fabian was in the part.

863
01:02:58,549 --> 01:03:01,152
Then-then he breaks his shoulder
doing a <i>Virginian.</i>

864
01:03:01,285 --> 01:03:02,486
That's how I got it, so...

865
01:03:02,618 --> 01:03:03,520
Ah.

866
01:03:05,256 --> 01:03:08,859
Hey, Rick, I gotta ask you
something I heard about.

867
01:03:08,991 --> 01:03:10,194
Was it true
you almost got

868
01:03:10,326 --> 01:03:12,029
the McQueen part
in <i>The Great Escape?</i>

869
01:03:13,698 --> 01:03:16,700
- Hilts, isn't it?
- Captain Hilts, actually.

870
01:03:16,832 --> 01:03:18,634
- Seventeen escape attempts.
- Eighteen.

871
01:03:18,768 --> 01:03:21,370
Never had an audition.
Never had a meeting.

872
01:03:21,504 --> 01:03:22,806
Never met John Sturges.

873
01:03:22,939 --> 01:03:25,474
So, no, I don't think
you could say I...

874
01:03:25,609 --> 01:03:27,578
I almost got the part, but...

875
01:03:27,710 --> 01:03:30,013
- Tunnel man, engineer.
- Flier.

876
01:03:30,147 --> 01:03:32,415
I suppose what's called in
the American Army,

877
01:03:32,549 --> 01:03:34,418
a hotshot pilot.

878
01:03:34,551 --> 01:03:38,622
But the story goes,
for a brief moment,

879
01:03:38,756 --> 01:03:41,558
McQueen almost passed
on the movie,

880
01:03:41,692 --> 01:03:43,193
and during that
brief moment,

881
01:03:43,326 --> 01:03:45,529
I, apparently,
was on a list of four.

882
01:03:45,661 --> 01:03:46,763
You have other plans?

883
01:03:46,897 --> 01:03:48,098
I haven't seen Berlin yet

884
01:03:48,232 --> 01:03:49,700
from the ground
or from the air,

885
01:03:49,832 --> 01:03:52,035
and I plan on doing both
before the war's over.

886
01:03:52,169 --> 01:03:53,569
You and who?

887
01:03:53,703 --> 01:03:56,873
- Me and... Me and three Georges.
- Which three Georges?

888
01:03:57,006 --> 01:03:58,475
Peppard, Maharis and Chakiris.

889
01:03:58,609 --> 01:04:00,110
- Oh, man.
- Yeah.

890
01:04:00,243 --> 01:04:01,478
That's gotta hurt.

891
01:04:01,611 --> 01:04:03,646
Yeah, well,
I didn't get it,

892
01:04:03,779 --> 01:04:05,082
McQueen did it,

893
01:04:05,216 --> 01:04:07,585
and, frankly,
I never had a chance.

894
01:04:09,152 --> 01:04:11,855
Ten days isolation,
Hilts.

895
01:04:11,989 --> 01:04:13,057
Captain Hilts.

896
01:04:13,189 --> 01:04:14,958
Twenty days.

897
01:04:15,091 --> 01:04:16,026
Right.

898
01:04:17,361 --> 01:04:20,196
Oh, you'll still be here
when I get out?

899
01:04:21,564 --> 01:04:23,200
Cooler.

900
01:05:18,388 --> 01:05:21,124
- One, please.
- Seventy-five cents.

901
01:05:23,993 --> 01:05:26,462
What if I'm in the movie?

902
01:05:26,596 --> 01:05:28,165
What do you mean?

903
01:05:28,297 --> 01:05:30,868
I mean, I'm in the movie.

904
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,468
I'm Sharon Tate.

905
01:05:32,602 --> 01:05:35,038
- You're in this?
- Mm-hm.

906
01:05:35,172 --> 01:05:37,308
I play Miss Carlson, the klutz.

907
01:05:38,741 --> 01:05:39,776
That's me.

908
01:05:41,544 --> 01:05:44,214
But that's the girl
from <i>Valley of the Dolls.</i>

909
01:05:45,850 --> 01:05:49,886
Well, that's me, the girl
from <i>Valley of the Dolls.</i>

910
01:05:50,020 --> 01:05:51,655
Really?

911
01:05:51,788 --> 01:05:53,056
Really.

912
01:05:55,491 --> 01:05:57,894
Hey, Rubin!
Come out here.

913
01:06:01,031 --> 01:06:03,868
This is the girl
from <i>Valley of the Dolls.</i>

914
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,035
- Patty Duke?
- No, the other one.

915
01:06:06,169 --> 01:06:08,339
- The girl from <i>Peyton Place?</i>
- No, the other one.

916
01:06:08,471 --> 01:06:10,774
The one who ends up
doing dirty movies.

917
01:06:10,906 --> 01:06:13,809
- Oh.
- She's in this movie.

918
01:06:13,944 --> 01:06:15,512
- Oh.
- Sharon Tate.

919
01:06:15,645 --> 01:06:19,015
Well, welcome
to the Bruin, Miss Tate.

920
01:06:19,149 --> 01:06:20,749
Thank you for coming
to our theater.

921
01:06:20,884 --> 01:06:22,886
Would you like to come in
and see the show?

922
01:06:23,020 --> 01:06:23,887
Could I?

923
01:06:24,020 --> 01:06:25,221
By all means.

924
01:06:26,223 --> 01:06:27,158
Thank you.

925
01:06:29,125 --> 01:06:31,027
Hey, can I get
a picture?

926
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:32,061
Oh, sure.

927
01:06:32,196 --> 01:06:33,096
Okay.

928
01:06:37,366 --> 01:06:39,702
You know, why don't you
stand over by the poster

929
01:06:39,837 --> 01:06:41,772
so people will know
who you are.

930
01:06:41,904 --> 01:06:44,140
Okay. Could you?

931
01:06:56,853 --> 01:06:58,321
Would you like
some refreshments?

932
01:06:58,455 --> 01:07:01,092
- Oh, I'm fine. Thank you.
- Enjoy the show.

933
01:07:37,294 --> 01:07:39,629
<i>Can I ask
you a personal question?</i>

934
01:07:39,763 --> 01:07:41,998
- <i>I wish you would.</i>
- <i>How did a nice boy</i>

935
01:07:42,131 --> 01:07:44,967
<i>like you get involved
with a group like the Heads?</i>

936
01:07:45,102 --> 01:07:46,969
<i>I turned to them
after I was rejected</i>

937
01:07:47,102 --> 01:07:49,172
<i>by the Daughters
of the American Revolution.</i>

938
01:08:11,627 --> 01:08:13,396
<i>Very pleasant hotel here.</i>

939
01:08:14,631 --> 01:08:16,166
- <i>Mr. Helm?</i>
- <i>Yes?</i>

940
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:17,367
<i>Oh!</i>

941
01:08:21,272 --> 01:08:22,706
<i>I'm Freya.</i>

942
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:25,175
<i>Welcome to Denmark,
Mr. Helm.</i>

943
01:08:25,309 --> 01:08:29,012
<i>These are for you. Street maps,
places of interest.</i>

944
01:08:29,145 --> 01:08:30,479
<i>This is for you too.</i>

945
01:08:32,248 --> 01:08:33,983
- <i>What year was that?</i>
- <i>1949.</i>

946
01:08:34,117 --> 01:08:35,785
<i>That's a very good year.</i>

947
01:08:35,919 --> 01:08:37,621
<i>I'm here to
help any way I can.</i>

948
01:08:37,754 --> 01:08:38,622
<i>Very nice of you.</i>

949
01:08:38,755 --> 01:08:39,622
<i>Is there anything</i>

950
01:08:39,755 --> 01:08:41,024
<i>you'd like me to do?</i>

951
01:08:41,157 --> 01:08:43,125
- <i>Yes, a couple things.</i>
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

952
01:08:43,259 --> 01:08:46,563
<i>Would you mind getting off
my camera case, please?</i>

953
01:08:46,697 --> 01:08:48,332
- <i>Oh, I'm sorry.</i>
- <i>Oh, that's all right.</i>

954
01:08:48,465 --> 01:08:50,500
- <i>I'm so sorry.</i>
- <i>That's okay.</i>

955
01:08:50,632 --> 01:08:51,602
<i>I'm sorry about...</i>

956
01:08:53,069 --> 01:08:54,670
<i>Welcome to Denmark.</i>

957
01:09:03,246 --> 01:09:06,248
<i>This is some kind of hotel
you've got here.</i>

958
01:09:08,551 --> 01:09:10,620
<i>Half a bottle
is better than none.</i>

959
01:09:20,229 --> 01:09:22,098
Morning, partner.

960
01:09:22,232 --> 01:09:24,602
Probably come
by to see you later.

961
01:09:58,401 --> 01:10:00,470
That's far enough,
jughead.

962
01:10:01,304 --> 01:10:02,806
Name's not jughead.

963
01:10:04,140 --> 01:10:06,343
What you doing
around here, boy?

964
01:10:06,475 --> 01:10:09,411
I'm thirsty. That's a saloon,
ain't it?

965
01:10:09,545 --> 01:10:12,614
Oh, yeah,
that's a saloon.

966
01:10:12,748 --> 01:10:15,286
- Only you can't come in.
- Mr. Gilbert.

967
01:10:17,220 --> 01:10:20,624
Don't let me stop you
from earning your money.

968
01:10:22,792 --> 01:10:24,827
I know how bored
and restless you get

969
01:10:24,961 --> 01:10:26,930
when you run out of tamales.

970
01:10:28,732 --> 01:10:30,934
But, Mr. Gilbert,
if I was you,

971
01:10:32,402 --> 01:10:34,904
I'd find out that
jughead's name.

972
01:10:36,372 --> 01:10:39,009
Allow me to introduce
the two of you.

973
01:10:40,743 --> 01:10:42,645
This here is Bob Gilbert.

974
01:10:43,813 --> 01:10:45,516
The Businessman?

975
01:10:45,648 --> 01:10:47,416
That's right.

976
01:10:47,550 --> 01:10:51,888
Business Bob Gilbert.
And who might he be, Caleb?

977
01:10:52,022 --> 01:10:55,225
Well,
that's a fella by the name of Madrid.

978
01:10:56,093 --> 01:10:57,493
Johnny Madrid.

979
01:10:58,495 --> 01:11:00,397
Who's Johnny Madrid?

980
01:11:06,635 --> 01:11:08,304
He ain't from round here.

981
01:11:08,438 --> 01:11:10,473
No, really.

982
01:11:10,605 --> 01:11:11,675
Who is he, Caleb?

983
01:11:16,479 --> 01:11:18,215
Oh, you're about
to find out...

984
01:11:20,017 --> 01:11:21,050
Businessman.

985
01:11:38,835 --> 01:11:41,739
Ready when you are,
Gilbert.

986
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:25,949
Johnny Madrid.

987
01:12:30,853 --> 01:12:32,623
How long has it been?

988
01:12:32,755 --> 01:12:36,225
Since that time in
Juárez, about three years ago.

989
01:12:36,358 --> 01:12:39,696
Well, come on in
and have a drink.

990
01:12:39,828 --> 01:12:42,198
Hell, in that case...

991
01:12:44,334 --> 01:12:46,603
buy you a drink, Caleb?

992
01:12:46,737 --> 01:12:47,805
Sure, Johnny.

993
01:12:49,238 --> 01:12:51,808
How about some mezcal?

994
01:12:51,942 --> 01:12:53,777
Like that time in Juárez.

995
01:12:55,444 --> 01:12:57,813
A lot of people
died that day.

996
01:12:57,947 --> 01:12:59,415
Yes, they did.

997
01:13:00,751 --> 01:13:03,353
But we had a good time.

998
01:13:03,486 --> 01:13:04,587
Didn't we?

999
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:06,689
Yeah, we did.

1000
01:13:07,823 --> 01:13:09,425
After you, DeCoteau.

1001
01:13:10,894 --> 01:13:13,864
Pepe! Get your behind
behind that bar.

1002
01:13:13,996 --> 01:13:15,698
I have a guest.

1003
01:13:31,814 --> 01:13:33,149
How's the beans?

1004
01:13:34,751 --> 01:13:36,119
I've had worse.

1005
01:13:38,388 --> 01:13:40,457
One dollar.

1006
01:13:43,425 --> 01:13:47,430
To my wife
and all my sweethearts.

1007
01:13:47,563 --> 01:13:49,632
May they never meet.

1008
01:13:56,105 --> 01:13:59,675
Señor Madrid, you care
to join me at my table

1009
01:13:59,809 --> 01:14:01,244
where I entertain
my guests?

1010
01:14:01,376 --> 01:14:03,913
I'd be
delighted, Monsieur DeCoteau.

1011
01:14:05,648 --> 01:14:07,584
Take the bottle
with you.

1012
01:14:09,285 --> 01:14:11,220
So, Johnny, ahem...

1013
01:14:13,121 --> 01:14:14,856
what brings you
to Arroyo del Oro?

1014
01:14:14,991 --> 01:14:17,894
Oh, you know me,
Caleb.

1015
01:14:18,027 --> 01:14:19,529
Money.

1016
01:14:20,830 --> 01:14:22,931
And who's paying
around here?

1017
01:14:23,065 --> 01:14:24,533
I hope you.

1018
01:14:24,667 --> 01:14:26,435
Huh.

1019
01:14:26,568 --> 01:14:28,937
And what have you
heard about me?

1020
01:14:29,072 --> 01:14:30,907
I heard about
the Lancer Ranch.

1021
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:33,209
All the cattle
you've appropriated.

1022
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:34,711
A lot of land,
a lot of cows,

1023
01:14:34,844 --> 01:14:36,680
a lot of money,
no law to speak of,

1024
01:14:36,813 --> 01:14:38,215
and nothing
but an old man

1025
01:14:38,348 --> 01:14:41,251
and some Mexican ranch hands
to shoo you off.

1026
01:14:43,486 --> 01:14:45,689
Say, where's that
chili pepper

1027
01:14:45,822 --> 01:14:48,091
daughter of yours
with the fiddle?

1028
01:14:48,224 --> 01:14:49,992
She's asleep.

1029
01:14:50,126 --> 01:14:52,195
Wake her the heck up,
get her down here

1030
01:14:52,327 --> 01:14:55,831
with her fiddle and her bow,
and entertain my guest.

1031
01:14:58,669 --> 01:15:00,871
But, please, don't hurt her
this time.

1032
01:15:02,505 --> 01:15:03,973
I ain't gonna hurt her.

1033
01:15:04,107 --> 01:15:07,810
I just want her
to play the fiddle.

1034
01:15:11,281 --> 01:15:14,117
Line? "Go... Go fetch her
and tell her" what?

1035
01:15:14,251 --> 01:15:15,752
"Go fetch her and tell her

1036
01:15:15,885 --> 01:15:17,754
I'll give her a fat
$5 gold piece..."

1037
01:15:17,888 --> 01:15:19,322
Right. Go fetch her
and tell her

1038
01:15:19,456 --> 01:15:21,291
I'll give her
a fat-fat $5 gold piece,

1039
01:15:21,424 --> 01:15:23,760
she play her little
chili pepper heart out, right?

1040
01:15:23,894 --> 01:15:25,228
- Right.
- Got it.

1041
01:15:31,434 --> 01:15:33,269
I ain't gonna hurt her.

1042
01:15:33,403 --> 01:15:35,638
I just want her
to play the fiddle.

1043
01:15:35,770 --> 01:15:37,107
Now, go fetch her
and tell her

1044
01:15:37,239 --> 01:15:38,774
I'll give her
a fat $5 gold piece,

1045
01:15:38,907 --> 01:15:41,944
she play her little
chili pepper heart out.

1046
01:15:42,077 --> 01:15:43,779
Go on.

1047
01:15:48,117 --> 01:15:49,785
So, Johnny,

1048
01:15:51,054 --> 01:15:52,654
what else you heard?

1049
01:15:52,788 --> 01:15:54,256
Hmm.

1050
01:15:54,390 --> 01:15:56,925
I heard you're pushing
Lancer pretty hard,

1051
01:15:57,059 --> 01:15:59,763
but Lancer's got money.

1052
01:16:00,929 --> 01:16:02,965
At some point,

1053
01:16:03,099 --> 01:16:05,368
he's gonna hire some guns

1054
01:16:05,501 --> 01:16:07,536
and push back.

1055
01:16:14,611 --> 01:16:17,613
- Line. Line. Line, line, line.
- "Maybe he already has."

1056
01:16:20,617 --> 01:16:21,952
Maybe... Goddamn it!

1057
01:16:22,085 --> 01:16:23,620
I fucked this
whole thing up, Sam.

1058
01:16:23,754 --> 01:16:24,955
Keep going!

1059
01:16:25,087 --> 01:16:26,355
- I fucked this up.
- Fight through it.

1060
01:16:26,488 --> 01:16:28,558
Can we just go back?
Please, can we just cut?

1061
01:16:28,692 --> 01:16:30,026
Just say the fucking line!

1062
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:31,594
No, really, Sam, please.

1063
01:16:31,728 --> 01:16:33,196
- "Maybe he already has."
- All right!

1064
01:16:33,328 --> 01:16:35,697
- "Maybe he already has!"
- All right, goddamn it!

1065
01:16:35,831 --> 01:16:36,799
All right, all right!

1066
01:16:36,933 --> 01:16:38,201
Woo!

1067
01:16:38,334 --> 01:16:40,370
You're a goddamn outlaw,
Rick. Come on, now.

1068
01:16:40,502 --> 01:16:42,005
Woo!

1069
01:16:42,138 --> 01:16:43,873
I got it. I got it.

1070
01:16:45,241 --> 01:16:46,609
Go back a bit, would you?

1071
01:16:46,742 --> 01:16:49,011
No, he's right. Back to one.

1072
01:16:49,144 --> 01:16:51,513
- Okay, now, use all that, baby.
- I'm gonna use it.

1073
01:16:51,647 --> 01:16:53,983
- Oh, I'm gonna use it.
- Put it all inside.

1074
01:16:54,116 --> 01:16:55,051
I'm gonna use it.

1075
01:16:57,153 --> 01:16:58,055
And...

1076
01:16:59,154 --> 01:17:00,523
action.

1077
01:17:03,425 --> 01:17:05,727
I heard you're pushing
Lancer pretty hard,

1078
01:17:05,862 --> 01:17:08,364
but Lancer's got money.

1079
01:17:09,532 --> 01:17:11,434
At some point,

1080
01:17:11,568 --> 01:17:15,839
he's gonna hire
some guns and push back.

1081
01:17:19,341 --> 01:17:22,077
Maybe he already has.

1082
01:17:22,211 --> 01:17:24,714
Maybe.

1083
01:17:27,550 --> 01:17:29,085
Maybe
I don't like Lancer.

1084
01:17:30,586 --> 01:17:32,388
Maybe I don't like
his boots.

1085
01:17:34,056 --> 01:17:35,724
Maybe I don't like the way

1086
01:17:35,858 --> 01:17:38,928
he uses those boots
to step on people.

1087
01:17:42,564 --> 01:17:44,132
What the fuck was that?!

1088
01:17:44,267 --> 01:17:46,702
Jesus Christ!

1089
01:17:46,836 --> 01:17:48,037
Fuck!

1090
01:17:48,170 --> 01:17:50,372
Piece of shit.

1091
01:17:50,506 --> 01:17:52,474
Fucking damn it, Rick,
I swear to God.

1092
01:17:52,608 --> 01:17:54,811
Forgot your fucking lines,
embarrassed yourself

1093
01:17:54,943 --> 01:17:57,145
like that in front of all
those goddamn people!

1094
01:17:57,278 --> 01:18:00,248
You were drinking all night,
fucking drinking again,

1095
01:18:00,382 --> 01:18:03,252
eight goddamn fucking
whiskey sours.

1096
01:18:03,385 --> 01:18:06,455
Fucking bullshit.

1097
01:18:08,491 --> 01:18:10,761
You're a fucking
miserable drunk.

1098
01:18:10,894 --> 01:18:13,196
Not fucking remembering
your fucking lines.

1099
01:18:13,330 --> 01:18:15,264
I practiced them,
and now I don't look

1100
01:18:15,398 --> 01:18:17,033
like I goddamn practiced them!

1101
01:18:17,166 --> 01:18:19,302
You're sitting there
like a fucking baboon!

1102
01:18:21,403 --> 01:18:23,105
Fuck! Eight fucking
whiskey sours.

1103
01:18:23,239 --> 01:18:26,209
I couldn't stop at fucking
three or four. I have eight!

1104
01:18:26,343 --> 01:18:28,077
Why?! You're
a fucking alcoholic.

1105
01:18:28,211 --> 01:18:29,913
You fucking drink
too much, huh?

1106
01:18:30,045 --> 01:18:32,414
Every fucking night.
Every fucking night.

1107
01:18:32,549 --> 01:18:34,149
That's it,
that's fucking it!

1108
01:18:34,282 --> 01:18:35,550
That's fucking it.

1109
01:18:35,684 --> 01:18:37,920
You stop drinking right now,
all right?

1110
01:18:38,054 --> 01:18:39,322
Make a promise to yourself.

1111
01:18:39,455 --> 01:18:41,558
You're gonna stop
fucking drinking.

1112
01:18:41,690 --> 01:18:42,725
Oh, fuck it.

1113
01:18:46,429 --> 01:18:48,230
Damn it!

1114
01:18:48,363 --> 01:18:50,065
You show that
little fucking girl.

1115
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:52,135
You're gonna show
that goddamn Jim Stacy.

1116
01:18:52,268 --> 01:18:54,670
You're gonna show them
on that goddamn fucking set

1117
01:18:54,804 --> 01:18:56,605
who the fuck
Rick Dalton is, all right?

1118
01:18:56,738 --> 01:18:58,840
Let me tell you something.

1119
01:18:58,974 --> 01:19:01,577
You don't get
these lines right,

1120
01:19:01,711 --> 01:19:04,614
I'm gonna blow
your fucking brains out tonight.

1121
01:19:04,747 --> 01:19:06,616
All right?
Your brains are gonna

1122
01:19:06,748 --> 01:19:09,085
be splattered
all over your goddamn pool.

1123
01:19:09,219 --> 01:19:11,153
I mean it, motherfucker.

1124
01:19:11,287 --> 01:19:12,555
Get your shit together.

1125
01:20:18,787 --> 01:20:20,522
- Better? Okay.
- It's great.

1126
01:21:46,509 --> 01:21:47,510
Hey!

1127
01:21:48,577 --> 01:21:49,479
Hi.

1128
01:21:53,282 --> 01:21:54,683
Huh.

1129
01:21:54,817 --> 01:21:56,819
Woo!

1130
01:21:56,952 --> 01:21:58,154
Shit.

1131
01:22:04,926 --> 01:22:07,330
Fuck you, you fucking pig!

1132
01:22:07,462 --> 01:22:09,299
Oh, no.

1133
01:22:24,679 --> 01:22:25,847
Hello, hot stuff.

1134
01:22:25,982 --> 01:22:28,317
Looks like third time's
the charm.

1135
01:22:28,450 --> 01:22:30,319
Mm. How were those pickles?

1136
01:22:33,622 --> 01:22:35,457
Real good.

1137
01:22:35,591 --> 01:22:36,893
They were
the fancy kind.

1138
01:22:37,026 --> 01:22:38,528
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

1139
01:22:39,929 --> 01:22:41,163
Give me a lift?

1140
01:22:41,296 --> 01:22:42,531
Where are you going?

1141
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,169
I'm going to Chatsworth.

1142
01:22:46,301 --> 01:22:48,237
Chatsworth?

1143
01:22:48,370 --> 01:22:51,073
You hitch up and down
Burbank Boulevard all day

1144
01:22:51,206 --> 01:22:53,741
till someone says they'll
drive you to Chatsworth?

1145
01:22:53,876 --> 01:22:55,512
Tourists love to drive me.

1146
01:22:55,644 --> 01:22:57,846
I'm their favorite part
of their L.A. vacation.

1147
01:22:57,980 --> 01:23:01,417
They'll be telling stories
about the Hollywood hippie girl

1148
01:23:01,550 --> 01:23:03,486
that they gave a ride
to the movie ranch

1149
01:23:03,620 --> 01:23:05,220
for the rest of their lives.

1150
01:23:05,354 --> 01:23:06,756
Wait, Spahn Movie Ranch?

1151
01:23:08,123 --> 01:23:09,591
- Yeah.
- That's where you're going?

1152
01:23:09,724 --> 01:23:10,658
Spahn Movie Ranch?

1153
01:23:10,792 --> 01:23:11,827
Uh-huh.

1154
01:23:11,961 --> 01:23:13,163
Why you going there?

1155
01:23:13,962 --> 01:23:14,863
I live there.

1156
01:23:15,730 --> 01:23:18,233
- Alone?
- No.

1157
01:23:18,367 --> 01:23:19,669
Me and my friends.

1158
01:23:21,104 --> 01:23:23,406
So you and a bunch
of friends like you

1159
01:23:23,538 --> 01:23:25,375
all live
at Spahn Movie Ranch?

1160
01:23:26,841 --> 01:23:27,743
Yeah.

1161
01:23:30,078 --> 01:23:31,648
Well, hop in.
I'll take you there.

1162
01:23:32,581 --> 01:23:33,783
Great!

1163
01:23:43,259 --> 01:23:45,426
Go down here and get on
the Hollywood Freeway.

1164
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:46,996
I know where it is.

1165
01:23:49,031 --> 01:23:52,301
Are you some old cowboy guy
that used to make movies there?

1166
01:23:52,434 --> 01:23:53,935
Whoa!

1167
01:23:54,069 --> 01:23:55,571
What?

1168
01:23:55,703 --> 01:23:57,072
I'm just surprised
how accurate

1169
01:23:57,206 --> 01:23:58,940
that description
of me really is.

1170
01:23:59,073 --> 01:24:02,411
Some old cowboy guy that used
to shoot movies at Spahn Ranch.

1171
01:24:02,545 --> 01:24:06,015
So you used to make Westerns
at the ranch

1172
01:24:06,148 --> 01:24:08,518
back in the old-timey days?

1173
01:24:10,286 --> 01:24:12,855
Well, if by
"the old-timey days,"

1174
01:24:12,987 --> 01:24:16,291
you mean television
eight years ago, yeah.

1175
01:24:16,425 --> 01:24:17,760
Are you an actor?

1176
01:24:17,894 --> 01:24:19,496
No, I'm a stuntman.

1177
01:24:20,763 --> 01:24:22,431
You're a stuntman.

1178
01:24:23,599 --> 01:24:25,735
That's way better.

1179
01:24:25,868 --> 01:24:27,170
Why is that way better?

1180
01:24:28,371 --> 01:24:30,607
- Actors are phony.
- Oh.

1181
01:24:30,739 --> 01:24:32,808
They just say lines
that other people write

1182
01:24:32,942 --> 01:24:36,612
and pretend to murder people
on their stupid TV shows.

1183
01:24:36,745 --> 01:24:39,814
Meanwhile, real people are being
murdered every day in Vietnam.

1184
01:25:02,504 --> 01:25:04,373
Want me to suck your cock
while driving?

1185
01:25:13,282 --> 01:25:14,284
How old are you?

1186
01:25:15,584 --> 01:25:16,551
What?

1187
01:25:16,684 --> 01:25:18,353
How old are you?

1188
01:25:20,689 --> 01:25:21,623
Wow, man.

1189
01:25:23,125 --> 01:25:24,926
That's the first time
anybody asked that

1190
01:25:25,059 --> 01:25:26,327
in a long time.

1191
01:25:26,461 --> 01:25:27,930
What's the answer?

1192
01:25:30,498 --> 01:25:33,903
Okay. We gonna play
kiddie games?

1193
01:25:35,203 --> 01:25:37,773
Eighteen. Feel better?

1194
01:25:37,907 --> 01:25:39,708
You got some ID,
you know,

1195
01:25:39,841 --> 01:25:42,009
like a driver's license
or something?

1196
01:25:42,144 --> 01:25:44,780
- Are you joking?
- No, I'm not.

1197
01:25:44,912 --> 01:25:48,383
I need to see something official
that verifies that you're 18,

1198
01:25:48,518 --> 01:25:51,287
which you don't have
because you're not.

1199
01:25:54,556 --> 01:25:57,059
Talk about a bring-down bummer,
dude.

1200
01:25:57,192 --> 01:25:58,261
That's you.

1201
01:25:58,394 --> 01:25:59,596
Yeah.

1202
01:26:04,166 --> 01:26:08,070
Obviously,
I'm not too young to fuck you.

1203
01:26:08,203 --> 01:26:10,372
But obviously,
you are too old to fuck me.

1204
01:26:11,907 --> 01:26:15,277
What I'm too old to do
is go to jail for poontang.

1205
01:26:17,246 --> 01:26:19,248
Prison's been trying to get me
all my life.

1206
01:26:19,381 --> 01:26:21,750
It ain't got me yet.
The day it does,

1207
01:26:21,884 --> 01:26:24,286
it won't be because of you.

1208
01:26:24,420 --> 01:26:25,555
No offense.

1209
01:26:28,523 --> 01:26:30,358
<i>You all right?</i>

1210
01:26:30,492 --> 01:26:32,861
She's just
fine, ain't you, shorty?

1211
01:26:32,995 --> 01:26:34,697
<i>I'm fine, Scott.</i>

1212
01:26:34,831 --> 01:26:36,297
<i>They haven't hurt you?</i>

1213
01:26:36,431 --> 01:26:38,233
Camera's ready, Mr. Dalton.

1214
01:26:39,934 --> 01:26:41,203
I'll be right out.

1215
01:26:42,604 --> 01:26:44,806
<i>The war.</i>

1216
01:26:44,940 --> 01:26:47,777
<i>I rode with
the British cavalry in Indi...</i>

1217
01:27:40,028 --> 01:27:42,665
Stand by, guys.
We're going in five.

1218
01:27:57,545 --> 01:28:00,048
Lancer's boys are here!

1219
01:28:00,181 --> 01:28:02,218
The old man here?

1220
01:28:02,350 --> 01:28:03,919
Nada.

1221
01:28:04,051 --> 01:28:05,520
But the son is.

1222
01:28:07,622 --> 01:28:09,590
Ah. Heh, heh.

1223
01:28:09,724 --> 01:28:11,193
The one from Boston.

1224
01:28:12,394 --> 01:28:13,328
I don't know.

1225
01:28:14,362 --> 01:28:15,730
You from Boston?

1226
01:28:15,864 --> 01:28:16,898
Yes.

1227
01:28:17,032 --> 01:28:18,501
It's the Boston one!

1228
01:28:20,303 --> 01:28:22,104
Keep the others outside.

1229
01:28:23,339 --> 01:28:24,674
Let the brother come in.

1230
01:28:26,309 --> 01:28:28,044
You heard him, Boston.

1231
01:28:37,019 --> 01:28:38,821
Come on in, Boston.

1232
01:28:40,121 --> 01:28:41,556
See, honey?

1233
01:28:41,690 --> 01:28:43,893
I told you they'd come
to parlay.

1234
01:28:45,527 --> 01:28:46,761
You all right,
honey?

1235
01:28:46,895 --> 01:28:49,898
Oh, she's just fine.

1236
01:28:50,032 --> 01:28:51,701
Ain't you, shorty?

1237
01:28:52,901 --> 01:28:54,836
I'm fine, Scott.

1238
01:28:54,970 --> 01:28:56,739
They haven't hurt you?

1239
01:28:56,871 --> 01:28:58,940
Not yet, I ain't.

1240
01:28:59,073 --> 01:29:00,876
But that can all change...

1241
01:29:02,044 --> 01:29:02,911
like that.

1242
01:29:06,747 --> 01:29:08,216
Say...

1243
01:29:08,349 --> 01:29:10,018
where'd you get that limp?

1244
01:29:11,487 --> 01:29:12,788
- From the war.
- Mm.

1245
01:29:14,089 --> 01:29:15,690
Which side?

1246
01:29:15,825 --> 01:29:19,027
I rode with the British cavalry
in India.

1247
01:29:19,161 --> 01:29:20,729
Mm.

1248
01:29:20,862 --> 01:29:23,364
What'd they call that outfit?

1249
01:29:23,497 --> 01:29:24,899
Bengal Lancers.

1250
01:29:28,836 --> 01:29:30,871
Now, now, now,
that is funny.

1251
01:29:31,005 --> 01:29:33,441
- That is funny.
- That's not so funny.

1252
01:29:33,575 --> 01:29:34,809
Don't you get it?

1253
01:29:34,943 --> 01:29:36,812
"Bengal Lancer"?

1254
01:29:36,944 --> 01:29:38,281
Hm?

1255
01:29:38,413 --> 01:29:39,748
Oh, yeah.

1256
01:29:39,881 --> 01:29:41,482
I get it now.

1257
01:29:41,617 --> 01:29:44,686
- That is kind of funny.
- It is.

1258
01:29:44,819 --> 01:29:48,189
You do know kidnapping
is a hanging offense.

1259
01:29:48,323 --> 01:29:50,792
So is blowing the heads
off little girls.

1260
01:29:52,327 --> 01:29:55,330
But they can only hang me
once, right?

1261
01:29:56,497 --> 01:29:57,433
So...

1262
01:29:59,067 --> 01:30:00,636
you come down here for a...

1263
01:30:00,769 --> 01:30:03,005
For a Boston social?

1264
01:30:03,138 --> 01:30:05,774
- Or we gonna talk price?
- How much?

1265
01:30:05,907 --> 01:30:09,877
I'd say $50,000 would buy me

1266
01:30:10,011 --> 01:30:13,482
a whole lot of chicken mole
in Mexico.

1267
01:30:13,614 --> 01:30:15,017
That's a lot of money.

1268
01:30:15,149 --> 01:30:17,486
Well, she's a lot
of little girl.

1269
01:30:17,618 --> 01:30:19,386
Or don't you agree?

1270
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:20,822
I agree.

1271
01:30:22,791 --> 01:30:24,459
So, what's next?

1272
01:30:24,593 --> 01:30:26,961
Well, I'll send one of my boys
out to your ranch

1273
01:30:27,095 --> 01:30:29,365
to fill you in
on all the details, but, uh...

1274
01:30:31,166 --> 01:30:35,071
the one detail I'm gonna fill
you in on right now is this:

1275
01:30:36,438 --> 01:30:39,373
I don't want
no beaner bronco buster

1276
01:30:39,507 --> 01:30:41,109
handing me that $50,000.

1277
01:30:41,243 --> 01:30:44,380
I want the old man himself.

1278
01:30:44,513 --> 01:30:50,051
Murdoch Lancer
puts $50,000 in my lap...

1279
01:30:50,184 --> 01:30:53,354
or I heave this little pitcher
down a well!

1280
01:30:53,487 --> 01:30:55,990
You got that, Boston?

1281
01:30:56,125 --> 01:30:57,859
Huh?

1282
01:30:57,992 --> 01:30:59,393
Yeah.

1283
01:30:59,528 --> 01:31:01,797
All right, messenger boy.

1284
01:31:03,331 --> 01:31:04,866
Deliver my message.

1285
01:31:11,639 --> 01:31:15,076
Give me evil, sexy Hamlet.

1286
01:31:15,210 --> 01:31:17,011
Settle into it.

1287
01:31:17,144 --> 01:31:19,147
Enjoy it.

1288
01:31:19,281 --> 01:31:20,381
And cut!

1289
01:31:23,051 --> 01:31:24,219
Oh, boy.

1290
01:31:24,353 --> 01:31:25,921
I didn't hurt you there,
Marabella,

1291
01:31:26,054 --> 01:31:28,390
- with that throw, did I?
- No, no, no. I'm good.

1292
01:31:28,523 --> 01:31:30,024
I got pads on.

1293
01:31:30,158 --> 01:31:32,161
And I throw myself on the floor

1294
01:31:32,294 --> 01:31:35,264
just for fun,
even when I'm not getting paid.

1295
01:31:35,397 --> 01:31:36,665
The gate's clean.

1296
01:31:36,797 --> 01:31:39,201
Rick, Rick, Rick.

1297
01:31:39,334 --> 01:31:40,903
Put her there.

1298
01:31:41,036 --> 01:31:42,136
- That was it.
- Really?

1299
01:31:42,270 --> 01:31:43,705
That was absolutely fantastic.

1300
01:31:43,839 --> 01:31:45,107
- Oh, thank you.
- I loved it.

1301
01:31:45,241 --> 01:31:47,109
Your idea about
throwing the little girl

1302
01:31:47,242 --> 01:31:49,044
on the ground
just worked like a charm.

1303
01:31:49,178 --> 01:31:51,145
I figured you said Shakespeare,
so... Yeah.

1304
01:31:51,279 --> 01:31:52,380
That's right. That was...

1305
01:31:52,514 --> 01:31:54,584
That's what I mean
by "scare me."

1306
01:31:54,716 --> 01:31:57,085
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
- Evil Hamlet scares people.

1307
01:31:57,219 --> 01:31:59,621
- All right.
- Oh, and by the way...

1308
01:31:59,754 --> 01:32:01,823
- "Beaner bronco buster"?
- Yeah.

1309
01:32:01,956 --> 01:32:03,491
Where the hell
did that come from?

1310
01:32:03,626 --> 01:32:05,761
- I don't know. Improv.
- That was wonderful.

1311
01:32:05,894 --> 01:32:09,298
It was just... That was
a triple alliterative improv.

1312
01:32:09,430 --> 01:32:10,933
You don't hear those
too often.

1313
01:32:11,065 --> 01:32:12,901
- Okay? We're good.
- All right. We don't...?

1314
01:32:13,035 --> 01:32:14,603
- Don't need to go again?
- We're done.

1315
01:32:14,736 --> 01:32:16,071
- That was fantastic.
- All right.

1316
01:32:16,203 --> 01:32:18,072
Okay, moving on.
We're in the bordello.

1317
01:32:18,206 --> 01:32:19,608
Next setup!

1318
01:32:23,411 --> 01:32:27,149
That was the best acting
I've ever seen in my whole life.

1319
01:32:28,617 --> 01:32:29,484
Thank you.

1320
01:32:29,617 --> 01:32:30,785
Heh.

1321
01:32:47,970 --> 01:32:49,438
Rick fucking Dalton.

1322
01:33:02,885 --> 01:33:03,986
That's a car.

1323
01:33:05,287 --> 01:33:06,756
That's a strange car.

1324
01:33:08,122 --> 01:33:10,459
Snake, go see
who's outside.

1325
01:33:22,938 --> 01:33:24,340
So who is it?

1326
01:33:24,473 --> 01:33:26,308
I ain't for sure yet.

1327
01:33:26,442 --> 01:33:28,643
It's a bitchen yellow
Coupe de Ville.

1328
01:33:28,777 --> 01:33:30,880
Keep an eye on him.

1329
01:34:19,728 --> 01:34:21,263
Come on.

1330
01:34:37,879 --> 01:34:39,614
Where the hell
is everybody?

1331
01:34:48,924 --> 01:34:50,358
Hey, where's Gypsy?

1332
01:34:50,492 --> 01:34:52,194
She's down
by the chop shop.

1333
01:34:59,033 --> 01:35:01,135
- Hey!
- Hello!

1334
01:35:01,269 --> 01:35:04,305
Gypsy! I want you
to come meet my new friend.

1335
01:35:04,438 --> 01:35:06,740
Some old-looking
dude in a Hawaiian shirt

1336
01:35:06,875 --> 01:35:08,544
who just gave Pussycat
a ride home.

1337
01:35:08,676 --> 01:35:10,278
He just gave her a lift?

1338
01:35:10,412 --> 01:35:12,414
Nope. She's bringing him

1339
01:35:12,547 --> 01:35:14,416
down the ranch
to meet everybody.

1340
01:35:14,550 --> 01:35:17,118
Stay by the door.
Tell me if he starts coming this way.

1341
01:35:19,287 --> 01:35:21,590
- Welcome to our community.
- Thanks for having me.

1342
01:35:21,723 --> 01:35:24,158
Thank you for giving
our precious Pussy a ride home.

1343
01:35:24,291 --> 01:35:25,493
Think nothing of it.

1344
01:35:25,626 --> 01:35:26,995
We love Pussy.

1345
01:35:27,129 --> 01:35:28,631
Yes, we do.

1346
01:35:28,764 --> 01:35:30,899
Hey, where is everybody?
Where's the children?

1347
01:35:31,032 --> 01:35:33,567
Everybody left
for Santa Barbara.

1348
01:35:33,702 --> 01:35:35,170
Really?

1349
01:35:35,304 --> 01:35:37,305
Charlie's gone?
Everybody left?

1350
01:35:37,438 --> 01:35:40,441
Well, not "everybody" everybody,
but mostly everybody.

1351
01:35:43,411 --> 01:35:44,313
Drag.

1352
01:35:45,714 --> 01:35:48,317
I really wanted Cliff
to meet Charlie.

1353
01:35:48,450 --> 01:35:50,719
I think Charlie's
really gonna dig you.

1354
01:35:50,853 --> 01:35:53,154
- Angel, hold up.
- Well, maybe next time.

1355
01:35:53,288 --> 01:35:55,724
Yeah, you got to come back.

1356
01:35:55,858 --> 01:35:57,827
- Yeah?
- Yeah, sure.

1357
01:35:59,661 --> 01:36:02,663
So how's it all
comparing to your glory days?

1358
01:36:02,796 --> 01:36:04,366
Well, things have changed.

1359
01:36:07,769 --> 01:36:09,671
Not a bad mount, Connie.

1360
01:36:09,804 --> 01:36:12,139
I used to ride horses
every day back in Tennessee.

1361
01:36:12,273 --> 01:36:14,309
- Is that right?
- Every day?

1362
01:36:14,442 --> 01:36:16,345
Well, every week.

1363
01:36:16,478 --> 01:36:18,046
All right.

1364
01:36:18,179 --> 01:36:19,880
Ain't she just darling?

1365
01:36:23,519 --> 01:36:26,688
So, uh, my name is Lulu.

1366
01:36:26,821 --> 01:36:28,590
This is Tex.

1367
01:36:28,724 --> 01:36:30,992
We're gonna be leading you
on a great trail ride

1368
01:36:31,126 --> 01:36:33,495
through the beautiful
Santa Susana canyons.

1369
01:36:33,629 --> 01:36:36,832
Now, Curt, I hear you're already
an experienced rider.

1370
01:36:36,965 --> 01:36:39,233
- Yes.
- Yeah, so are you, Connie?

1371
01:36:39,367 --> 01:36:41,370
- Yes, I am.
- Hey, Tex? Come here.

1372
01:36:41,502 --> 01:36:44,005
So, uh, if you're both
experienced riders,

1373
01:36:44,139 --> 01:36:47,276
I guess we'll just make
this ride about having fun.

1374
01:36:47,408 --> 01:36:48,675
You ready to have some fun?

1375
01:36:48,809 --> 01:36:51,545
So Pussycat brought back
some guy with her.

1376
01:36:51,679 --> 01:36:53,647
Gypsy wants you
to go give him a look-see.

1377
01:36:53,781 --> 01:36:55,350
Yeah. Sure thing.

1378
01:37:14,202 --> 01:37:17,172
Oh, and here's someone
you absolutely have to meet.

1379
01:37:17,305 --> 01:37:19,607
One of our most favorite sons.

1380
01:37:19,741 --> 01:37:22,377
Tex, come on over here
and say hi to Cliff.

1381
01:37:22,510 --> 01:37:24,612
- Howdy, Cliff.
- Tex.

1382
01:37:24,746 --> 01:37:28,250
- What part of Texas you from?
- Oh, a place you never heard of.

1383
01:37:28,382 --> 01:37:29,250
Copeville.

1384
01:37:29,384 --> 01:37:31,587
Ah. Ever been to Houston?

1385
01:37:31,720 --> 01:37:33,188
Course I have.

1386
01:37:33,321 --> 01:37:35,790
Yeah, I spent two weeks once
on a Houston chain gang.

1387
01:37:35,924 --> 01:37:37,559
In August, no less.

1388
01:37:37,692 --> 01:37:40,095
That doesn't sound like
a whole lot of fun.

1389
01:37:40,228 --> 01:37:43,131
It's the last cop's jaw I ever
broke, I can tell you that.

1390
01:37:47,568 --> 01:37:48,469
Man...

1391
01:37:49,772 --> 01:37:52,241
Charlie's gonna dig you.

1392
01:37:52,373 --> 01:37:54,643
The Hawaiian guy
seems to be okay.

1393
01:37:54,776 --> 01:37:57,178
Everybody's talking
all friendly.

1394
01:37:57,312 --> 01:37:59,846
- Enjoy your day!
- Thank you.

1395
01:37:59,980 --> 01:38:03,151
Tex checked him out,
and now he's riding away.

1396
01:38:03,285 --> 01:38:05,586
If he comes this
way, let me know.

1397
01:38:08,256 --> 01:38:10,825
Hey, does George Spahn
still own this ranch?

1398
01:38:10,959 --> 01:38:13,495
Yeah, George
still owns it.

1399
01:38:13,627 --> 01:38:16,031
- Does he still live here?
- Yeah.

1400
01:38:16,163 --> 01:38:19,032
Does he still live
right there?

1401
01:38:19,166 --> 01:38:20,134
Yeah.

1402
01:38:20,268 --> 01:38:21,536
Is he here now?

1403
01:38:21,670 --> 01:38:23,272
I guess so.

1404
01:38:25,273 --> 01:38:27,875
So George gave you all
permission to be here?

1405
01:38:29,109 --> 01:38:30,278
Course he did.

1406
01:38:30,412 --> 01:38:31,981
And y'all take care of him?

1407
01:38:33,180 --> 01:38:35,283
Oh, we take care
of George.

1408
01:38:35,416 --> 01:38:36,517
We love George.

1409
01:38:38,920 --> 01:38:40,321
Well,
is there anything wrong

1410
01:38:40,455 --> 01:38:42,623
with me saying hello
to an old friend?

1411
01:38:42,756 --> 01:38:44,526
You can't see him
right now.

1412
01:38:44,658 --> 01:38:46,894
Why can't I see him
right now?

1413
01:38:48,496 --> 01:38:50,164
Because
he's napping.

1414
01:38:51,965 --> 01:38:53,968
This is his nap time.

1415
01:39:03,478 --> 01:39:06,047
Well, I think I'll just
go see for myself.

1416
01:39:07,415 --> 01:39:09,216
You never know.

1417
01:39:09,349 --> 01:39:11,018
He might have just woke up.

1418
01:39:20,595 --> 01:39:22,731
The old Hawaiian
guy's coming this way.

1419
01:39:23,965 --> 01:39:25,567
Okay, y'all, beat it.

1420
01:39:25,700 --> 01:39:27,036
I'll handle this guy.

1421
01:39:31,139 --> 01:39:32,140
Fine.

1422
01:40:17,786 --> 01:40:19,288
You the mama bear?

1423
01:40:21,089 --> 01:40:23,158
- Can I help you?
- I hope so.

1424
01:40:23,291 --> 01:40:26,259
I'm an old friend of George's.
Thought I'd stop and say hello.

1425
01:40:26,394 --> 01:40:27,762
That's very nice of you,

1426
01:40:27,894 --> 01:40:29,730
but you picked
the wrong time.

1427
01:40:29,864 --> 01:40:31,832
George is taking a nap
right now.

1428
01:40:31,966 --> 01:40:33,835
Oh, that is unfortunate.

1429
01:40:33,968 --> 01:40:35,237
Yes, it is.

1430
01:40:36,604 --> 01:40:39,007
- What's your name?
- Cliff Booth.

1431
01:40:39,140 --> 01:40:40,507
How do you know George?

1432
01:40:40,642 --> 01:40:43,010
I used to shoot Westerns
here at the ranch.

1433
01:40:43,144 --> 01:40:45,413
When was the last time
you saw George?

1434
01:40:45,546 --> 01:40:48,750
Oh, I'd say about...

1435
01:40:49,651 --> 01:40:50,986
eight years ago.

1436
01:40:52,554 --> 01:40:54,089
Oh. I'm sorry.

1437
01:40:54,223 --> 01:40:56,357
I didn't realize the two of you
were so close.

1438
01:40:56,491 --> 01:40:58,193
When he wakes up,

1439
01:40:58,327 --> 01:41:00,429
I'll let him know you came by.

1440
01:41:00,562 --> 01:41:03,064
I'd really like to say
a quick hello now

1441
01:41:03,197 --> 01:41:04,431
while I'm here.

1442
01:41:04,564 --> 01:41:06,067
Came a long ways.

1443
01:41:06,200 --> 01:41:08,937
Don't know when I'll get back
this way again.

1444
01:41:09,069 --> 01:41:12,506
Oh, I understand, but I'm
afraid that's impossible.

1445
01:41:12,639 --> 01:41:14,274
Impossible?

1446
01:41:14,408 --> 01:41:16,143
Why is that impossible?

1447
01:41:16,278 --> 01:41:18,513
Me and George like
to watch TV on Sunday night...

1448
01:41:18,647 --> 01:41:20,782
<i>F.B.I.</i> and <i>Bonanza.</i>
...but George finds it hard

1449
01:41:20,916 --> 01:41:22,350
to keep awake,
so I make him nap

1450
01:41:22,483 --> 01:41:24,619
so I don't get gypped out
of my TV time.

1451
01:41:24,752 --> 01:41:25,987
Ah.

1452
01:41:27,322 --> 01:41:31,359
Well, look, Red,
I'm coming in there.

1453
01:41:31,492 --> 01:41:35,496
With my own two eyes, I'm gonna
get a good look at George.

1454
01:41:36,264 --> 01:41:37,466
And this...

1455
01:41:39,466 --> 01:41:41,103
ain't stopping me.

1456
01:41:44,572 --> 01:41:45,473
Okay.

1457
01:41:46,675 --> 01:41:48,210
Suit yourself.

1458
01:43:14,261 --> 01:43:15,930
He back there?

1459
01:43:17,265 --> 01:43:19,233
Door at the end
of the hallway.

1460
01:43:20,535 --> 01:43:22,069
You might have to
shake him awake.

1461
01:43:22,203 --> 01:43:23,938
I fucked his brains out
this morning.

1462
01:43:29,210 --> 01:43:31,212
He may be tired.

1463
01:43:42,791 --> 01:43:44,459
Oh, Mr. Eight Years Ago?

1464
01:43:46,294 --> 01:43:47,761
George is blind,

1465
01:43:47,894 --> 01:43:50,431
so you'll probably
have to tell him who you are.

1466
01:44:15,922 --> 01:44:17,358
George, you awake?

1467
01:44:35,777 --> 01:44:36,712
George?

1468
01:44:39,113 --> 01:44:40,047
George?

1469
01:44:44,118 --> 01:44:45,019
George?

1470
01:44:47,888 --> 01:44:50,390
- George!
- Jesus.

1471
01:44:50,524 --> 01:44:53,027
- Hi, George.
- Wait a minute.

1472
01:44:53,161 --> 01:44:55,197
- What's going on?
- Everything's all right.

1473
01:44:55,330 --> 01:44:58,399
- I'm sorry to disturb you.
- Uh... Who are you?

1474
01:44:58,532 --> 01:45:00,402
It's Cliff Booth.

1475
01:45:00,535 --> 01:45:03,604
Just stopped in to say hello
and see how you're doing.

1476
01:45:03,737 --> 01:45:05,205
John Wilkes Booth?

1477
01:45:05,339 --> 01:45:06,675
No, Cliff Booth.

1478
01:45:09,010 --> 01:45:10,244
Who's that?

1479
01:45:10,377 --> 01:45:12,913
I used to shoot
<i>Bounty Law</i> here, George.

1480
01:45:13,046 --> 01:45:15,015
I was Rick Dalton's
stunt double.

1481
01:45:15,149 --> 01:45:17,919
- Who?
- Rick Dalton.

1482
01:45:18,051 --> 01:45:19,586
The Dalton Brothers?

1483
01:45:19,720 --> 01:45:21,322
No, Rick Dalton.

1484
01:45:22,857 --> 01:45:24,024
Who's that?

1485
01:45:24,158 --> 01:45:26,928
He was the star
of <i>Bounty Law.</i>

1486
01:45:27,060 --> 01:45:28,729
And who are you?

1487
01:45:28,862 --> 01:45:30,498
I was Rick's stunt double.

1488
01:45:31,698 --> 01:45:33,567
Rick who?

1489
01:45:33,701 --> 01:45:35,403
It don't matter, George.

1490
01:45:35,536 --> 01:45:38,573
We were colleagues
from the past, and I just wanted

1491
01:45:38,706 --> 01:45:40,541
to make sure
you're doing okay.

1492
01:45:40,675 --> 01:45:42,944
- I'm not doing okay.
- What's the matter?

1493
01:45:43,077 --> 01:45:44,746
Can't see shit.

1494
01:45:44,879 --> 01:45:46,614
Would you call that
"the matter"?

1495
01:45:46,747 --> 01:45:48,448
The man can't see shit,
okay?

1496
01:45:48,582 --> 01:45:51,018
I know. I'm sorry about that.
I was told.

1497
01:45:51,152 --> 01:45:53,721
Squeaky
sent me to bed.

1498
01:45:53,854 --> 01:45:56,089
Would that be
the little redhead out front?

1499
01:45:59,094 --> 01:46:01,529
What the fuck
is the matter with you?

1500
01:46:01,662 --> 01:46:03,097
First you wake me up,

1501
01:46:03,230 --> 01:46:05,599
and now you're pretending
that I didn't tell you

1502
01:46:05,733 --> 01:46:07,769
I was fucking blind!

1503
01:46:07,902 --> 01:46:10,938
How am I gonna know
what the hell color the head

1504
01:46:11,072 --> 01:46:13,774
of the girl is that's with me
all the time?

1505
01:46:13,907 --> 01:46:15,676
Oh, fair enough, George.

1506
01:46:19,212 --> 01:46:22,483
- No. Jesus Christ.
- Come on, George. All right.

1507
01:46:22,617 --> 01:46:25,120
Everyone
don't need a stuntman.

1508
01:46:32,760 --> 01:46:35,163
I don't know who you are...

1509
01:46:36,797 --> 01:46:38,834
but you touched me today.

1510
01:46:40,835 --> 01:46:43,337
You came to visit me.

1511
01:46:43,470 --> 01:46:45,505
Now I got to go back to sleep.

1512
01:46:48,076 --> 01:46:50,711
I got to watch
<i>F.B.I.</i> tonight.

1513
01:46:50,845 --> 01:46:52,347
I watch it with Squeaky.

1514
01:46:53,814 --> 01:46:57,285
She gets all pissed off
if I fall asleep.

1515
01:46:57,417 --> 01:47:00,221
What happens when she
gets pissed off, George?

1516
01:47:01,589 --> 01:47:02,623
Nothing.

1517
01:47:04,291 --> 01:47:06,627
I just don't like
to disappoint her.

1518
01:47:11,498 --> 01:47:15,202
So you gave all these hippies
permission to be here?

1519
01:47:20,774 --> 01:47:23,176
Just who the fuck are you?

1520
01:47:23,309 --> 01:47:25,178
I'm Cliff Booth.

1521
01:47:25,312 --> 01:47:26,514
I'm a stuntman.

1522
01:47:26,647 --> 01:47:28,815
We used to work together,
George.

1523
01:47:28,950 --> 01:47:31,652
And I just want
to make sure you're okay.

1524
01:47:31,786 --> 01:47:35,456
And that all these hippies
aren't taking advantage of you.

1525
01:47:35,589 --> 01:47:38,326
- Squeaky?
- Yeah.

1526
01:47:38,459 --> 01:47:40,729
She loves me.

1527
01:47:42,929 --> 01:47:45,032
So suck on that.

1528
01:47:53,506 --> 01:47:55,175
You take care, George.

1529
01:48:02,015 --> 01:48:03,651
Goddamn it.

1530
01:48:25,105 --> 01:48:26,575
You embarrassed me.

1531
01:48:27,575 --> 01:48:29,911
Yeah, sorry about that.

1532
01:48:32,380 --> 01:48:34,114
How'd your little talk
with George go?

1533
01:48:34,247 --> 01:48:35,248
Are we kidnapping him?

1534
01:48:35,381 --> 01:48:37,117
Not the word I'd use.

1535
01:48:37,251 --> 01:48:39,454
Now you've talked to him, you
believe everything's all right?

1536
01:48:39,586 --> 01:48:41,421
Not exactly.

1537
01:48:41,555 --> 01:48:43,456
This was a mistake.
You should leave.

1538
01:48:43,590 --> 01:48:45,326
Way ahead of you.

1539
01:48:49,464 --> 01:48:51,599
George isn't blind!

1540
01:48:51,732 --> 01:48:53,301
You're the blind one!

1541
01:49:38,145 --> 01:49:39,813
You do that?

1542
01:49:44,919 --> 01:49:46,955
You know, that's not my car.

1543
01:49:47,087 --> 01:49:49,157
That's my boss's car.

1544
01:49:49,290 --> 01:49:51,593
And if something were to happen
to my boss's car,

1545
01:49:51,725 --> 01:49:53,161
well, I'd get in trouble.

1546
01:50:11,479 --> 01:50:12,880
Fix it.

1547
01:50:13,013 --> 01:50:15,183
Fuck you.

1548
01:50:41,407 --> 01:50:43,611
- Leave him alone!
- He's a flower!

1549
01:50:43,745 --> 01:50:45,279
He's a flower, man.

1550
01:50:45,412 --> 01:50:47,747
He's just a flower.
He doesn't know better.

1551
01:50:47,881 --> 01:50:49,683
Ladies.

1552
01:50:55,723 --> 01:50:58,760
Come one step closer
and I will knock his teeth out.

1553
01:51:10,170 --> 01:51:11,805
Fix it.

1554
01:51:11,938 --> 01:51:14,207
Can I at least get a rag
to wipe my face first?

1555
01:51:14,340 --> 01:51:15,809
Nope.

1556
01:51:15,943 --> 01:51:17,611
Tire first.

1557
01:51:27,589 --> 01:51:29,622
- Sundance.
- Yeah.

1558
01:51:29,756 --> 01:51:33,260
Get on a horse, go get Tex
and get his ass down here.

1559
01:51:33,394 --> 01:51:34,295
Okay.

1560
01:51:43,604 --> 01:51:45,306
<i>I love you.</i>

1561
01:52:09,697 --> 01:52:12,132
Tex! Tex!

1562
01:52:12,267 --> 01:52:13,968
That Hawaiian guy's
back at the ranch

1563
01:52:14,102 --> 01:52:15,269
kicking Clem's face in.

1564
01:52:15,403 --> 01:52:17,171
Ah, son of a...

1565
01:52:17,304 --> 01:52:18,772
I'll take over for Tex.

1566
01:52:18,906 --> 01:52:20,575
Right this way.

1567
01:52:47,201 --> 01:52:49,037
Hyah! Hyah!

1568
01:53:10,825 --> 01:53:12,492
Clem, you all right?

1569
01:53:33,714 --> 01:53:35,349
How do?

1570
01:53:35,483 --> 01:53:38,753
What a day.
Shit, I almost lost my shit.

1571
01:54:26,867 --> 01:54:28,069
You, uh...

1572
01:54:28,202 --> 01:54:30,271
You want to come in
and watch my <i>F.B.I.?</i>

1573
01:54:30,404 --> 01:54:33,174
Why, I just figured we would.
I got a six-pack in the back.

1574
01:54:33,306 --> 01:54:34,575
Thought we'd order a pizza.

1575
01:54:34,707 --> 01:54:35,942
All right.

1576
01:54:36,076 --> 01:54:37,344
All right.

<i>Any kind of luck,

1579
01:55:03,438 --> 01:55:05,940
<i>and back at El Toro
before my kids go to bed.</i>

1580
01:55:10,778 --> 01:55:14,515
Hey, bought me
an acid-dipped cigarette today.

1581
01:55:14,648 --> 01:55:15,950
Oh, yeah?

1582
01:55:16,082 --> 01:55:18,118
You want to buy
a cigarette dipped in acid?

1583
01:55:18,251 --> 01:55:19,786
Yeah.

1584
01:55:19,920 --> 01:55:21,955
If I'm gonna trip,
I want to trip here, man.

1585
01:55:22,089 --> 01:55:24,158
Walk in the woods.
Not in my home.

1586
01:55:26,126 --> 01:55:27,294
Just gonna stash it here.

1587
01:55:27,428 --> 01:55:29,529
- Don't smoke it by mistake.
- Yeah.

1588
01:55:29,663 --> 01:55:32,498
You want to smoke some,
smoke some. Just save me some.

1589
01:55:32,632 --> 01:55:35,868
Nah, I don't need
to trip out on no acid.

1590
01:55:36,002 --> 01:55:37,839
My booze don't need no buddy.

1591
01:55:37,971 --> 01:55:39,172
Whoa! Oh!

1592
01:55:39,305 --> 01:55:41,142
Here I come. Here I come.

1593
01:55:43,176 --> 01:55:44,377
Mm.

1594
01:55:44,510 --> 01:55:46,546
<i>What's the trouble, corporal?</i>

1595
01:55:46,679 --> 01:55:48,215
<i>There's a truck tailing us,
sir.</i>

1596

<i>It might be a farmer
in a hurry to get someplace.</i>

1597
01:55:55,822 --> 01:55:57,490
<i>Oh, fine.</i>

1598
01:55:57,625 --> 01:55:59,794
<i>Well,
take it as fast as you can.</i>

1599
01:55:59,926 --> 01:56:00,995
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

1600
01:56:04,297 --> 01:56:05,632
That PCH?

1601
01:56:05,765 --> 01:56:08,736
Yeah, yeah. Malibu.

1602
01:56:08,868 --> 01:56:11,171
Puerco Canyon or some shit.
I don't know.

1603
01:56:17,010 --> 01:56:19,679
Uh-oh. Here comes trouble.

1604
01:56:22,849 --> 01:56:24,184
Boom! Ha, ha!

1605
01:56:24,318 --> 01:56:26,254
Oh, man. Right in the face.

1606
01:56:38,165 --> 01:56:39,733
That was a smooth leap.

1607
01:56:39,867 --> 01:56:40,768
Thank you.

1608
01:56:44,104 --> 01:56:46,941
Dead number two.

1609
01:56:53,679 --> 01:56:55,414
I like that shot.

1610
01:56:55,549 --> 01:56:58,051
That guy's a fucking prick.

1611
01:57:04,358 --> 01:57:06,294
Um, that's Bobby Hogan.
Good guy.

1612

All right, get ready

Except when Rick Dalton's

<i>in the Italian film industry.</i>

Yes, Mr. Schwarz.

1640
01:58:49,496 --> 01:58:50,663
Two words.

1641
01:58:50,797 --> 01:58:53,233
Nebraska Jim, Sergio Corbucci.

1642
01:58:53,366 --> 01:58:55,269
N-Nebraska what?

1643
01:58:55,402 --> 01:58:56,404
Sergio who?

1644
01:58:56,537 --> 01:58:58,072
<i>Sergio Corbucci.</i>

1645
01:58:58,205 --> 01:58:59,672
A-and who's that?

1646
01:58:59,806 --> 01:59:01,207
The second-best director

1647
01:59:01,340 --> 01:59:03,442
of Spaghetti Westerns
in the whole wide world.

1648
01:59:03,577 --> 01:59:06,881
He's doing a new Western.
It's called <i>Nebraska Jim.</i>

1649
01:59:07,014 --> 01:59:09,450
And because of me,
he's considering you.

1650
01:59:09,582 --> 01:59:12,451
<i>Well, Rick got</i> Nebraska Jim.

1651
01:59:12,586 --> 01:59:14,955
<i>And Rick made a rather
compelling Nebraska Jim,</i>

1652
01:59:15,089 --> 01:59:17,457
<i>existing quite nicely
within Sergio Corbucci's</i>

<i>rogues gallery of antiheroes.</i>

1654
01:59:21,362 --> 01:59:22,930
<i>In Rome,
Rick loved the paparazzi</i>

1655
01:59:23,063 --> 01:59:24,597
<i>and the fuss
they made over him</i>

1656
01:59:24,730 --> 01:59:28,268
<i>and his</i> Nebraska Jim
<i>costar Daphna Ben-Cobo.</i>

1657
01:59:28,401 --> 01:59:31,906
All right there, paparazzos.
All right. Take it easy.

1658
01:59:32,038 --> 01:59:34,640
<i>He loved the food
so much that during his stay,</i>

1659
01:59:34,774 --> 01:59:36,609
<i>Rick gained
almost 15 pounds.</i>

1660
01:59:36,743 --> 01:59:39,612
<i>But he didn't love the
Italians' way of making movies.</i>

1661
01:59:39,746 --> 01:59:41,414
<i>In fact,
he thought the post-synced,</i>

1662
01:59:41,547 --> 01:59:43,416
<i>"every actor
speaks their own language,"</i>

<i>of European movies

1665

<i>While in Rome,
Marvin plugged Rick</i>

1666
01:59:50,424 --> 01:59:52,193
<i>into three other
Italian productions.</i>

1667

<i>pseudonym for Giorgio Ferroni.</i>

1672
02:00:02,368 --> 02:00:04,804
<i>His third was
an Italian/Spanish coproduction</i>

1673
02:00:04,938 --> 02:00:06,640
<i>that paired him

<i>James Bond rip-off-type flick</i>

<i>Italian sojourn
fairly profitable,</i>

1683
02:01:11,604 --> 02:01:13,506
<i>although his swank
Roman apartment</i>

1684
02:01:13,639 --> 02:01:15,575
<i>ate up a big chunk
of his earnings.</i>

1685
02:01:17,443 --> 02:01:20,513
<i>So as Rick returns to Hollywood
via Pan Am,</i>

1686

<i>towards a new life
and uncertain future,</i>

1692
02:01:36,063 --> 02:01:39,200
<i>Rick was really not sure
about what lay ahead for him.</i>

1693
02:01:41,635 --> 02:01:43,870
<i>Way back in coach,</i>

1694
02:01:44,004 --> 02:01:46,273
<i>working on his
bottomless Bloody Mary,</i>

1695
02:01:46,406 --> 02:01:49,910
<i>Cliff Booth returned
to Los Angeles as well.</i>

1696
02:01:50,044 --> 02:01:51,478
<i>He kept Rick company</i>

1697
02:01:51,612 --> 02:01:54,581
<i>during his entire
six-month stay in Italy.</i>

1698
02:01:54,715 --> 02:01:57,985
<i>However,
as the two men return home,</i>

1699
02:01:58,117 --> 02:01:59,719
<i>they've come
to an understanding.</i>

1700
02:01:59,854 --> 02:02:01,155
Well, here it goes now.

1701
02:02:02,723 --> 02:02:03,690
With the, uh...

1702
02:02:05,192 --> 02:02:06,727
With the new wife, I, uh...

1703
02:02:08,194 --> 02:02:11,197
I just I can't afford you
anymore, Cliff.

1704
02:02:11,331 --> 02:02:14,701
You know? I can barely afford
my own house anymore.

1705
02:02:14,835 --> 02:02:17,504
So I think the plan
is to sell the house

1706
02:02:17,636 --> 02:02:21,407
and buy-buy a condo in-in-in
Toluca Lake, bank the money.

1707
02:02:21,541 --> 02:02:24,177
You know, live off it.
That type of thing.

1708
02:02:24,310 --> 02:02:27,179
Hopefully,
I score come next pilot season.

1709
02:02:27,313 --> 02:02:28,448
That's a good plan.

1710
02:02:28,581 --> 02:02:30,616
Yeah. You know,

1711
02:02:30,751 --> 02:02:33,120
by then, I'll know
if I have a career or not,

1712
02:02:33,254 --> 02:02:37,256
if I'm a solid Los Angeles
citizen like Eddie O'Brien says,

1713
02:02:37,389 --> 02:02:41,627
or if I'm one step closer
to going back to Missouri.

1714
02:02:41,761 --> 02:02:45,032
So when this whole
European journey is over,

1715
02:02:45,165 --> 02:02:46,233
I think we've, uh...

1716
02:02:47,902 --> 02:02:50,304
We've reached
the end of the trail, Cliff.

1717
02:03:01,447 --> 02:03:03,450
<i>So these last
four Italian flicks,</i>

1718
02:03:03,584 --> 02:03:05,019
<i>after nine years together,</i>

1719
02:03:05,152 --> 02:03:08,255
<i>would be Rick and Cliff's
final rodeo.</i>

1720
02:03:08,389 --> 02:03:11,091
<i>Cliff doesn't have a clue
what he's gonna do.</i>

1721
02:03:11,224 --> 02:03:13,327
<i>The only thing the two men
know of for sure:</i>

1722
02:03:13,460 --> 02:03:15,162
<i>Tonight,
Rick and Cliff will have</i>

1723
02:03:15,295 --> 02:03:17,130
<i>a good old-fashioned drunk.</i>

1724
02:03:17,264 --> 02:03:20,300
<i>Both men know, once the plane
touches down in El Segundo,</i>

1725
02:03:20,433 --> 02:03:22,702
<i>it'll be the end of an era
for both of them.</i>

1726
02:03:22,836 --> 02:03:25,338
<i>And when you come to the end
of the line with a buddy</i>

1727
02:03:25,471 --> 02:03:28,175
<i>who is more than a brother
and a little less than a wife,</i>

1728
02:03:28,308 --> 02:03:29,710

02:15:22,822 --> 02:15:24,723
but fucking drive it,
and drive it now!

1884
02:15:24,857 --> 02:15:26,426
Okay. Okay. Stop yelling.

1885
02:15:26,559 --> 02:15:28,094
Hold your horses. We're leaving.

1886
02:15:31,997 --> 02:15:35,667
The hell are you looking at,
you little ginger-haired fucker?

1887
02:15:35,801 --> 02:15:39,672
Hey, you come around here again,
I'm gonna call the fucking cops!

1888
02:15:45,377 --> 02:15:46,845
Dirty fucking hippies.

1889
02:15:59,826 --> 02:16:01,527
There in his
fancy fucking house,

1890
02:16:01,661 --> 02:16:03,296
thinking he's handled it.

1891
02:16:03,429 --> 02:16:06,032
But he's seen us.
He's awake. He's alert.

1892
02:16:06,165 --> 02:16:09,402
They're all awake. They're
listening to fucking records.

1893
02:16:09,535 --> 02:16:10,937
Everybody's fucking awake!

1894
02:16:11,069 --> 02:16:12,205
Look!

1895
02:16:12,337 --> 02:16:14,806
- What did Charlie say?
- He said:

1896
02:16:14,940 --> 02:16:18,978
"Go to Terry's old house
and kill everybody in there."

1897
02:16:19,112 --> 02:16:22,781
And you heard him yourself.
He said, "Make it witchy."

1898
02:16:22,915 --> 02:16:25,917
Now, he either said that,

1899
02:16:26,051 --> 02:16:27,786
or I'm a liar.

1900
02:16:29,255 --> 02:16:32,358
Now, are any one of you
calling me a liar?

1901
02:16:33,426 --> 02:16:34,960
Hm?

1902
02:16:35,094 --> 02:16:36,928
How about you?

1903
02:16:37,062 --> 02:16:38,564
Are you calling me a liar?

1904
02:16:40,033 --> 02:16:42,068
No, of course not.

1905
02:16:42,201 --> 02:16:43,068
Good.

1906
02:16:43,202 --> 02:16:44,570
Hold it.

1907
02:16:44,703 --> 02:16:47,139
- Was that Rick Dalton?
- Who?

1908
02:16:47,273 --> 02:16:48,473
The guy from <i>Bounty Law.</i>

1909
02:16:48,606 --> 02:16:50,308
- Who, Jake Cahill?
- Yeah.

1910
02:16:50,443 --> 02:16:53,379
That guy in the robe
was Jake Cahill.

1911
02:16:53,513 --> 02:16:55,748
Wait a minute.
That was fucking Jake Cahill

1912
02:16:55,882 --> 02:16:57,317
that just yelled at me?

1913
02:16:57,450 --> 02:16:59,218
He was older,
but, yeah, I think so.

1914
02:16:59,352 --> 02:17:00,453
So who's this Rick guy?

1915
02:17:00,587 --> 02:17:02,389
Jesus Christ, Sadie,
get it together.

1916
02:17:02,522 --> 02:17:04,722
Rick Dalton played Jake Cahill
on a cowboy show

1917
02:17:04,856 --> 02:17:06,224
in the '50s called
<i>Bounty Law.</i>

1918
02:17:06,357 --> 02:17:07,659
Fuck you, Katie.

1919
02:17:07,793 --> 02:17:09,161
Sorry I don't know
the name

1920
02:17:09,294 --> 02:17:11,062
of every fascist on TV
in the '50s.

1921
02:17:11,196 --> 02:17:15,633
I can't believe that asshole
in the robe was Jake Cahill.

1922
02:17:15,767 --> 02:17:18,504
When I was a kid,
I had a <i>Bounty Law</i> lunch box.

1923
02:17:18,636 --> 02:17:20,907
That was my favorite
of all my lunch boxes.

1924
02:17:22,275 --> 02:17:24,978
Dig this!

1925
02:17:25,111 --> 02:17:26,979
When we've been having
our trip sessions,

1926
02:17:27,112 --> 02:17:29,649
I've been expanding
on this one idea in my head.

1927
02:17:29,782 --> 02:17:31,283
All right, dig it.

1928
02:17:31,417 --> 02:17:34,886
We all grew up watching TV,
you know what I mean?

1929
02:17:35,019 --> 02:17:36,554
And if you grew up watching TV,

1930
02:17:36,688 --> 02:17:38,558
that means you grew up
watching murder.

1931
02:17:38,690 --> 02:17:39,559
Mm-hm.

1932
02:17:39,692 --> 02:17:41,327
Every show on TV

1933
02:17:41,460 --> 02:17:44,196
that wasn't <i>I Love Lucy</i>
was about murder.

1934
02:17:44,329 --> 02:17:47,366
So my idea is...

1935
02:17:47,499 --> 02:17:49,868
we kill the people
who taught us to kill.

1936
02:17:51,937 --> 02:17:53,505
I mean,
where the fuck are we, man?

1937
02:17:53,640 --> 02:17:56,042
We are in fucking Hollywood,
man.

1938
02:17:56,176 --> 02:17:57,977
The people
an entire generation grew up

1939
02:17:58,109 --> 02:17:59,746
watching kill people
live here.

1940
02:17:59,879 --> 02:18:01,847
And they live
in pig-shit fucking luxury.

1941
02:18:01,981 --> 02:18:03,482
I say fuck them.

1942
02:18:03,615 --> 02:18:06,051
I say we cut their cocks off
and make them eat it.

1943
02:18:06,186 --> 02:18:08,355
That's a great idea, Sadie.

1944
02:18:10,790 --> 02:18:12,525
You two ready
to kill some piggies?

1945
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,202
Wait a minute. Oh, shit.

1946
02:18:24,337 --> 02:18:26,705
Sorry, I forgot my knife
in the car.

1947
02:18:26,838 --> 02:18:28,640
Can I go...?
Can I go back and get it?

1948
02:18:29,775 --> 02:18:31,044
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay.

1949
02:18:31,177 --> 02:18:33,145
- Go on. Wait a minute.
- What?

1950
02:18:33,278 --> 02:18:35,381
I locked the car.
You'll need keys to get in.

1951
02:18:38,451 --> 02:18:39,585
Oh.

1952
02:18:39,718 --> 02:18:41,553
Right. Thank you.

1953
02:18:41,687 --> 02:18:44,322
- Okay. I'll be right back.
- Okay.

1954
02:18:44,456 --> 02:18:47,426
- Just hurry up.
- Yeah, just a little minute.

1955
02:18:57,737 --> 02:18:59,372
Oh, that fucking bitch!

1956
02:18:59,505 --> 02:19:00,606
Shh! Calm down.

1957
02:19:00,740 --> 02:19:02,409
There's a fucking house
right there.

1958
02:19:03,709 --> 02:19:04,710
What do we do now?

1959
02:19:04,844 --> 02:19:06,278
We do what we came to do.

1960
02:19:06,411 --> 02:19:09,180
And when we're done,
we split up and hitch home.

1961
02:19:09,314 --> 02:19:10,515
Any more questions?

1962
02:19:10,650 --> 02:19:11,885
Hm?

1963
02:19:13,819 --> 02:19:16,589
Okay, pig killers,
let's kill some piggies.

1964
02:19:16,722 --> 02:19:17,924
All right.

1965
02:19:30,635 --> 02:19:32,438
Oh, someone's hungry.

1966
02:19:41,213 --> 02:19:42,315
All right.

1967
02:19:44,249 --> 02:19:46,119
It's feeding time.

1968
02:19:49,122 --> 02:19:50,290
Brandy, couch.

1969
02:19:56,928 --> 02:19:58,297
And don't you mo...

1970
02:20:06,772 --> 02:20:08,707
Oh, man.

1971
02:20:11,443 --> 02:20:12,345
Uh...

1972
02:20:17,817 --> 02:20:19,853
The train
has left the station.

1973
02:20:26,792 --> 02:20:28,027
Bad idea.

1974
02:21:28,653 --> 02:21:30,156
Whoa.

1975
02:22:17,535 --> 02:22:20,671
You go around there,
see if there's a back entrance.

1976
02:22:20,805 --> 02:22:22,641
All right? Go.

1977
02:23:09,654 --> 02:23:10,956
Hey.

1978
02:23:13,992 --> 02:23:18,029
I am doing the best I can
under the circumstances.

1979
02:23:18,163 --> 02:23:20,332
Now, I do not want
to get into it tonight.

1980
02:23:29,775 --> 02:23:32,511
Uh... can I help you?

1981
02:23:38,884 --> 02:23:39,918
Shit.

1982
02:23:41,320 --> 02:23:43,154
How many other people
are here?

1983
02:23:43,288 --> 02:23:46,058
Oh, just the one sleeping
in the back there.

1984
02:23:47,659 --> 02:23:50,395
Go get him and bring him
into the living room.

1985
02:23:50,528 --> 02:23:51,663
What if he says no?

1986
02:23:51,797 --> 02:23:53,265
Don't take no for an answer.

1987
02:23:53,398 --> 02:23:55,935
You're the one with the knife.
Get him in here!

1988
02:23:58,237 --> 02:23:59,739
Hey.

1989
02:24:05,143 --> 02:24:06,945
You are real, right?

1990
02:24:07,079 --> 02:24:09,716
I'm as real as a doughnut,
motherfucker.

1991
02:24:19,591 --> 02:24:21,025
What the fuck?

1992
02:24:27,933 --> 02:24:29,233
Go to the living room.

1993
02:24:29,367 --> 02:24:31,036
What is going on, huh?

1994
02:24:36,107 --> 02:24:37,809
- Go!
- Okay. <i>Si, si.</i>

1995
02:24:40,178 --> 02:24:41,546
Who the fuck's that?

1996
02:24:41,680 --> 02:24:42,581
I don't know.

1997
02:24:43,981 --> 02:24:44,916
Francesca.

1998
02:24:51,723 --> 02:24:54,392
Oh. Uh...

1999
02:24:54,526 --> 02:24:56,261
What...?

2000
02:24:56,394 --> 02:24:58,095
Oh, I know you.

2001
02:24:58,230 --> 02:24:59,966
I know all three of you.

2002
02:25:01,266 --> 02:25:03,802
Yeah. Spahn Ranch.

2003
02:25:03,936 --> 02:25:06,606
Spahn Ranch. Yeah. Hoo!

2004
02:25:08,240 --> 02:25:12,077
I don't know your name,
but I remember that hair.

2005
02:25:12,211 --> 02:25:15,714
And you, I remember
your white little face.

2006
02:25:15,847 --> 02:25:17,749
And you were on a horsie.

2007
02:25:17,883 --> 02:25:19,618
Yeah.

2008
02:25:19,750 --> 02:25:22,820
Uh... You are...?

2009
02:25:22,954 --> 02:25:24,789
I'm the devil,

2010
02:25:24,922 --> 02:25:28,260
and I'm here to do
the devil's business.

2011
02:25:30,963 --> 02:25:34,600
Nah, it was dumber than that.
Something like... Rex.

2012
02:25:34,732 --> 02:25:36,736
- God, shoot him, Tex!
- Tex.

2013
02:25:40,239 --> 02:25:41,340
Fuck!

2014
02:25:56,454 --> 02:25:57,856
Son of a bitch!

2015
02:26:36,328 --> 02:26:37,230
Hey, you.

2016
02:26:40,297 --> 02:26:42,435
How dare you come into my house,
motherfucker!

2017
02:27:08,526 --> 02:27:10,194
Wow, man.

2018
02:28:03,382 --> 02:28:04,483
What the fuck?

2019
02:28:05,983 --> 02:28:07,519
Jesus Christ.

2020
02:29:24,295 --> 02:29:25,697
Holy shit.

2021
02:29:28,767 --> 02:29:31,569
Francesca! Francesca, honey!

2022
02:29:50,821 --> 02:29:52,790
<i>10,000 block, Cielo Drive.</i>

2023
02:29:52,924 --> 02:29:56,127
Around what time was it
when you confronted the intruder?

2024
02:29:56,260 --> 02:29:58,095
It was about midnight.

2025
02:29:58,230 --> 02:29:59,364
- Around midnight?
- Yeah.

2026
02:29:59,498 --> 02:30:01,065
How do you know
it was midnight?

2027
02:30:01,200 --> 02:30:04,436
Well, I was, uh...
I was in the kitchen.

2028
02:30:04,569 --> 02:30:07,773
You know, I was
making margaritas, and, uh...

2029
02:30:07,907 --> 02:30:09,607
I heard the sound
of a noisy muffler.

2030
02:30:09,740 --> 02:30:11,409
I looked up at the clock.

2031
02:30:11,543 --> 02:30:13,545
It said... The kitchen clock
said midnight.

2032
02:30:13,677 --> 02:30:15,212
Twelve o'clock exactly?

2033
02:30:15,347 --> 02:30:17,449
I mean,
it could have been 12:05.

2034
02:30:17,581 --> 02:30:19,917
- Something like that.
- And you didn't see them again

2035
02:30:20,052 --> 02:30:22,153
until the woman attacked you
in the pool.

2036
02:30:22,286 --> 02:30:24,222
No, no.

2037
02:30:24,356 --> 02:30:26,425
So,
what did these perpetrators do?

2038
02:30:26,559 --> 02:30:29,094
Perpetrators?
They were hippie assholes.

2039
02:30:29,227 --> 02:30:32,665
Two of them burst through
the front door there,

2040
02:30:32,797 --> 02:30:37,102
and the guy hippie
said he was the devil.

2041
02:30:37,236 --> 02:30:39,938
And he said, "I'm here to...

2042
02:30:40,071 --> 02:30:42,174
do some devil shit."

2043
02:30:42,306 --> 02:30:44,909
Or...
That's not verbatim, but...

2044
02:30:45,043 --> 02:30:47,813
- "Some devil shit"?
- Yeah, "devil shit."

2045
02:31:01,960 --> 02:31:03,996
And away we go.

2046
02:31:07,198 --> 02:31:09,300
Hey. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

2047
02:31:09,434 --> 02:31:11,069
What hospital you going to,
Cliff?

2048
02:31:11,203 --> 02:31:12,437
I'll meet you there, huh?

2049
02:31:12,570 --> 02:31:14,939
You don't want to meet me
in no hospital.

2050
02:31:15,072 --> 02:31:16,908
Why don't you go take care
of your lady.

2051
02:31:17,042 --> 02:31:19,911
Hey, she just took
five fucking sleeping pills.

2052
02:31:20,044 --> 02:31:21,813
She'll be asleep
till Columbus Day.

2053
02:31:21,946 --> 02:31:24,415
These guys will probably
have to come out here again

2054
02:31:24,549 --> 02:31:26,785
- just to wake her ass up.
- Hey, I'm not gonna die.

2055
02:31:26,918 --> 02:31:28,754
I may get a limp,
but I ain't gonna die.

2056
02:31:28,888 --> 02:31:30,822
- It's not my time yet, man.
- All right.

2057
02:31:30,955 --> 02:31:33,291
So no use waiting
in some waiting room.

2058
02:31:33,425 --> 02:31:36,493
Why don't you go lie naked
with that fine creature.

2059
02:31:36,627 --> 02:31:38,129
Come visit me tomorrow.

2060
02:31:38,263 --> 02:31:40,499
Bring bagels.

2061
02:31:40,632 --> 02:31:43,001
You want to do something for me,
check on Brandy.

2062
02:31:43,134 --> 02:31:44,969
She may be a little shook up
after that.

2063
02:31:45,103 --> 02:31:47,473
- She may want to sleep with you.
- Are you kidding me?

2064
02:31:47,606 --> 02:31:49,440
She's sleeping
with Francesca right now.

2065
02:31:49,575 --> 02:31:51,475
You might never get her back.
Ha, ha.

2066
02:31:51,609 --> 02:31:53,310
- We got to go.
- All right, then, Cliff.

2067
02:31:53,445 --> 02:31:55,814
I'll see you tomorrow, then.

2068
02:31:59,284 --> 02:32:00,752
Hey. Hey.

2069
02:32:04,722 --> 02:32:06,491
You're a good friend, Cliff.

2070
02:32:07,992 --> 02:32:09,160
I try.

2071
02:32:41,559 --> 02:32:42,461
Hello?

2072
02:32:44,428 --> 02:32:45,296
Hey.

2073
02:32:45,429 --> 02:32:46,463
I'm Jay Sebring.

2074
02:32:46,597 --> 02:32:48,632
I'm a friend of the Polanskis.

2075
02:32:48,766 --> 02:32:51,303
You're Rick Dalton,
right?

2076
02:32:51,436 --> 02:32:54,973
Yeah. Yeah. I'm Rick Dalton.

2077
02:32:55,106 --> 02:32:56,907
- Live next door.
- Oh, I know.

2078
02:32:57,042 --> 02:32:59,678
I tease Sharon that she lives
next door to Jake Cahill.

2079
02:32:59,811 --> 02:33:01,779
If she ever wants to put
a bounty on Roman,

2080
02:33:01,912 --> 02:33:03,547
she just has to go next door,
right?

2081
02:33:05,383 --> 02:33:07,084
No shit.

2082
02:33:07,219 --> 02:33:09,553
What the fuck happened?

2083
02:33:09,687 --> 02:33:12,222
Oh, th-these fucking
hippie weirdos,

2084
02:33:12,356 --> 02:33:14,593
they-they-they
broke into my house.

2085
02:33:14,725 --> 02:33:17,362
What do you mean, like,
trying to rob you?

2086
02:33:17,495 --> 02:33:19,297
We don't know what the fuck
they wanted.

2087
02:33:19,430 --> 02:33:21,131
Were they robbing me?
I don't know.

2088
02:33:21,266 --> 02:33:23,368
Were they freaking out
on some bummer trip?

2089
02:33:23,500 --> 02:33:26,772
Who knows? But they tried
to kill my wife and my buddy.

2090
02:33:26,904 --> 02:33:30,275
- Jesus Christ. Are you serious?
- Yeah, I'm fucking serious.

2091
02:33:30,409 --> 02:33:34,079
Now, my buddy and his dog
killed two of them, and then...

2092
02:33:34,213 --> 02:33:37,215
Well, shit.
I-I torched the last one.

2093
02:33:37,348 --> 02:33:39,084
- "Torched"?
- Yeah.

2094
02:33:39,216 --> 02:33:41,620
I burnt her ass to a crisp.

2095
02:33:41,752 --> 02:33:44,623
- How'd you do that?
- Well, believe it or not, I...

2096
02:33:44,757 --> 02:33:46,957
I got a flamethrower
in my toolshed.

2097
02:33:47,091 --> 02:33:49,595
Oh, from <i>The Fourteen Fists</i>
<i>of McCluskey.</i>

2098
02:33:49,728 --> 02:33:51,463
Yeah!

2099
02:33:51,597 --> 02:33:53,064
Yeah. Yeah.

2100
02:33:53,197 --> 02:33:54,732
That's... That's the one.

2101
02:33:54,865 --> 02:33:58,068
Yeah, it still works too.
Thank God.

2102
02:33:58,202 --> 02:33:59,504
Is everybody okay?

2103
02:33:59,638 --> 02:34:02,106
Well, the fucking hippies
aren't,

2104
02:34:02,240 --> 02:34:03,976
that's for goddamn sure.

2105
02:34:04,108 --> 02:34:05,642
Yeah. But I'm fine.

2106
02:34:05,776 --> 02:34:07,477
You know, my wife's fine.

2107
02:34:07,612 --> 02:34:10,314
We're just a little shook up,
is all.

2108
02:34:10,448 --> 02:34:13,884
- Oh, my God, that's terrifying.
- Yeah.

2109
02:34:14,018 --> 02:34:16,720
<i>Jay,
honey, is everything all right?</i>

2110
02:34:16,855 --> 02:34:18,823
Everything's okay now, honey.

2111
02:34:18,956 --> 02:34:21,693
But some hippies
broke into the house next door.

2112
02:34:21,826 --> 02:34:23,629
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

2113
02:34:23,761 --> 02:34:25,631
<i>Oh, that's terrifying.</i>

2114
02:34:25,764 --> 02:34:27,331
<i>Is everybody okay?</i>

2115
02:34:27,465 --> 02:34:31,336
I'm talking to your next-door
neighbor about it right now.

2116
02:34:31,469 --> 02:34:32,871
<i>Rick Dalton?</i>

2117
02:34:34,639 --> 02:34:37,008
Yeah, that's me. Heh.

2118
02:34:37,141 --> 02:34:39,510
<i>Oh. Well, hello, neighbor.</i>

2119
02:34:40,612 --> 02:34:42,347
<i>Is everybody okay?</i>

2120
02:34:42,480 --> 02:34:45,417
Yes, Sharon,
everybody's fine.

2121
02:34:45,551 --> 02:34:47,686
<i>Are you okay?</i>

2122
02:34:49,221 --> 02:34:51,756
Well, yes, I am.
Thank you for asking that.

2123
02:34:51,890 --> 02:34:54,259
<i>Rick,
would you like to come up to the house</i>

2124
02:34:54,391 --> 02:34:56,861
<i>for a drink
and meet my other friends?</i>

2125
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:06,169
Yeah, sure.
Thank you.

2126
02:35:06,303 --> 02:35:08,906
<i>Oh, hooray! Great.
I'll buzz you up.</i>

2127
02:35:20,618 --> 02:35:21,519
Come on.

2128
02:35:25,290 --> 02:35:27,425
- Hey, nice to meet you, huh?
- Yeah.

2129
02:35:27,558 --> 02:35:28,993
- Jay Sebring.
- Hey, pleasure.

2130
02:35:29,126 --> 02:35:30,161
- Yeah.
- Pleasure, Jay.

2131
02:35:30,294 --> 02:35:31,428
Pleasure's all mine.

2132
02:35:31,562 --> 02:35:33,363
Sounds like you had
a hell of a night.

2133
02:38:52,364 --> 02:38:54,099
Hi. This is Rick Dalton,

2134
02:38:54,231 --> 02:38:56,733
better known as bounty hunter
Jake Cahill,

2135
02:38:56,867 --> 02:39:00,270
speaking on behalf
of Red Apple cigarettes.

2136
02:39:00,403 --> 02:39:03,507
Now, I smoke Red Apples.
Been smoking them for years.

2137
02:39:03,641 --> 02:39:05,976
But since the Red Apple
tobacco company's

2138
02:39:06,111 --> 02:39:08,579
been around since 1862,

2139
02:39:08,713 --> 02:39:11,917
<i>you'll see Jake Cahill
smoke Red Apple too.</i>

2140
02:39:12,050 --> 02:39:15,152
<i>Now, back in Jake's day,
Red Apple came in a pouch,</i>

2141
02:39:15,285 --> 02:39:17,120
<i>and he had to roll his own.</i>

2142
02:39:17,255 --> 02:39:20,158
But today, Red Apple
comes factory-rolled.

2143
02:39:20,291 --> 02:39:23,894
For the best drag
with the best tobacco flavor,

2144
02:39:24,028 --> 02:39:25,929
with less burn on your throat

2145
02:39:26,063 --> 02:39:28,499
than any other
non-filtered cigarette.

2146
02:39:34,873 --> 02:39:36,174
Mm!

2147
02:39:37,942 --> 02:39:40,478
Now, that's the way
a cigarette should taste.

2148
02:39:40,612 --> 02:39:41,479
Hm.

2149
02:39:41,613 --> 02:39:44,448
Better drag, more flavor,

2150
02:39:44,581 --> 02:39:45,983
less throat burn.

2151
02:39:48,385 --> 02:39:50,988
That's the Red Apple way.

2152
02:39:51,123 --> 02:39:54,793
So look for this life-size
standee of me, Jake Cahill,

2153
02:39:54,926 --> 02:39:58,496
wherever fine Red Apple tobacco
products are sold.

2154
02:39:58,630 --> 02:40:01,832
Take a bite
and feel all right.

2155
02:40:01,965 --> 02:40:05,268
Take a bite of
a Red Apple.

2156
02:40:05,402 --> 02:40:06,804
Tell them Jake sent you.

2157
02:40:09,940 --> 02:40:11,141
And cut.

2158
02:40:11,275 --> 02:40:13,077
This cigarette tastes like
fucking shit.

2159
02:40:13,211 --> 02:40:14,979
And, by the way,
who chose this photo?

2160
02:40:15,113 --> 02:40:16,546
I have a double chin.
All right?

2161
02:40:16,680 --> 02:40:17,982
Nobody notices that crap?

2162
02:40:23,843 --> 02:40:28,843
