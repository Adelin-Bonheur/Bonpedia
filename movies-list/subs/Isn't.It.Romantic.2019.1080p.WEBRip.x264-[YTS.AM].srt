<i>- Yes.
- I'll be gone most of the day.</i>

18
00:01:01,103 --> 00:01:03,564
Wake up, Natalie. It's just a movie.

19
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:06,942
Forget about men.

20
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:08,944
Forget about love.

21
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:12,239
In real life,
girls like us don't get that.

22
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:13,198
Why?

23
00:01:13,282 --> 00:01:15,617
Well, look in the mirror, darl.
We're no Julia Roberts.

24
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:16,701
We're not?

25
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:19,371
That woman has got a million-dollar smile.

26
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:21,790
She's got a gorgeous mane of hair.

27
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:24,209
Okay, she might not have
to bleach her mustache,

28
00:01:24,293 --> 00:01:26,753
but she hasn't even got room
for a mustache.

29
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:28,964
She's got a tiny little space here.

30
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:31,425
They'll never make a movie
about girls like us.

31
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:32,508
- You know why?
- Why?

32
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:34,845
Because it would be so sad.

33
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:37,389
They'd have to sprinkle Prozac
on the popcorn

34
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:39,099
or people would kill themselves.

35
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,105
You see, Natalie, love's not a fairytale.
There's no happy endings.

36
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:47,983
- There is always gonna be a happy ending.
- No, darling.

37
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:50,652
Someone might marry you for a visa,
that's about it.

Oh, Baxter, I need those. Hey.

44
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,481
Baxter? Pyeow!

45
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:28,982
Roll over. Play dead.

46
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:31,943
Come here.

47
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:34,029
Aah!

48
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,572
Morning kiss for Mummy?

49
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:38,909
Baxter?

50
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:52,089
Oh, hi, Donny.

51
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:55,467
Some girl taped this love note to my door.
"To Big D."

52
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,987
I think it's one of the many girls
that are obsessed with you.

53
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:00,180
Yeah, all... all right,
I'll give it to my secretary.

54
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:02,140
- Thanks.
- Oh, you have a secre...

55
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,704
- Stop the cart!
- What?

56
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:25,706
- Stop it with your body!
- Me?

57
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:27,207
- Do it!
- No, I can't!

58
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,292
- My cart is valuable!
- I can't!

59
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:30,502
Stop the cart!

60
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:32,796
Wow!

61
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,840
You're built like a cement truck.

62
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:36,925
Yeah. Thank you.

63
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,594
That's what all the guys say.

64
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:56,653
Hey, Nat, do me a favor,
throw this away for me. I'm so busy.

65
00:03:56,737 --> 00:04:00,490
Uh, I'm kind of... busy too,
but yeah, yeah.

66
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:04,745
Natalie, the 3D printer is down.
Can you call the IT guy?

67
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:07,706
Donna, you know, technically
you're the office manager, right?

68
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:10,751
I do. Tell him
it's not even turning on now.

69
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:11,918
You're the best.

70
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:15,422
Morning, Whit.

71
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:17,758
- Hey.
- Morning, boss.

72
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:19,593
- Is he here yet?
- No, not yet.

73
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:21,887
You're gonna kill
the Lewis pitch this morning.

74
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:25,098
Okay, uh, I don't know
whether I'm fully ready, but...

75
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:26,284
Oh, no, I haven't...

76
00:04:26,308 --> 00:04:28,668
- Whoa. Hold that thought, he's here.
- Maybe I shouldn't...

77
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,549
That's our new client?

78
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:31,831
Why is he so beautiful?

79
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:34,065
He's, like, CW hot.

80
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:36,777
I just suddenly got the urge to catcall.

81
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,279
Like, I... I don't whistle,
but I just, like, wanna...

82
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:44,910
Guys, please don't objectify
the men in this office.

83
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:46,953
Okay, I won't stand for it.

84
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:48,789
So, you gonna pitch in there?

85
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:50,874
I do... I don't know.

86
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,757
No one really cares
about the parking garages.

87
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:53,877
Mm-mm.

88
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,963
No, no, no, no. You are not
chickening out. It's a good idea.

89
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:59,883
I don't know. Sometimes
when I go into the big meetings,

90
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,677
they just cut me off
and I don't get my ideas out right,

91
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:05,013
and everyone just thinks
I'm the coffee bitch.

92
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:08,266
Which is unfair,
'cause sometimes I bring donuts as well.

93
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:11,603
Maybe I could just e-mail it.

94
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:13,897
Oh, yeah, you're right,
you could just e-mail it.

95
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,191
That's a good idea,
you should just sit down,

96
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:18,318
not go in the big meeting,

97
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,111
not present all your hard work.

98
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:21,655
'Cause that would be awful, right?

99
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:24,533
- Josh!
- Everyone loving your great work,

100
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:26,201
possibly getting a pay raise...

101
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:27,994
everyone's respect.

102
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:30,288
Everyone would be like,
"Wow, Natalie,

103
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:31,915
we love your idea!

104
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,292
We're gonna give you
all the money in the world!"

105
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:35,961
Josh, stop being such an idiot!

106
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:38,296
You're the most formidable
architect in this firm.

107
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,548
Oh, people are listening!

108
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:40,631
Natalie?

109
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:43,343
You gonna join us
for our professional meeting?

110
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:46,388
Yes, erm... Yes, I am, sorry.

111
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:49,307
Kill it, Nat!

112
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:54,187
Sorry about that. Excuse me.

113
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:58,732
Oh, thanks, hon.

114
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,902
- Oh, no, that's mi...
- Mm!

115
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:03,905
Oh, goddamn it.

116
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:05,532
Who puts whipped cream in a coffee?

117
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:07,655
Do you mind?
I'll just have a normal coffee. Thanks.

118
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:09,077
I'm not an assistant, so...

119
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,162
Archi... Architect. I'm ju...

120
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:13,123
Yeah, er... But, erm...

121
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:16,293
I'm also a team player and...

122
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,504
I'd be very happy
to get you another coffee.

123
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:20,588
That'd be great.

124
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:23,842
Um, be right back, everyone.

125
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,231
Miss, yo?

126
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:39,315
Yo?

127
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,378
Dropped your glasses. Here you go.

128
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,921
- Thank you.
- I'm cheesing really hard.

129
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,447
Are you... Oh!

130
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:46,698
- Come on!
- Very sorry.

131
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:50,619
So, it's not like I thought I was gonna be
the star of the meeting, or anything.

132
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:52,370
Like, I'm not that good.

133
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:56,416
But even if I see him again,
a guy like that, I'm just invisible to.

134
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,587
- What do you mean, a guy like that?
- You know, a nice guy with a nice life.

135
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,797
I'm a nice guy. I see you.

136
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:04,506
I've got a nice life.

137
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:07,093
I do. I have a hybrid.

138
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:08,511
Yeah, I know. I know.

139
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:11,431
No, you know what I mean.
Like, super rich,

140
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:14,935
like, super successful, a super hunky guy.

141
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:17,687
I'm just extra invisible
to a guy like that, you know?

142
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:20,190
Yeah, got it.

143
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:26,947
You know, even if he noticed you,
you wouldn't notice him noticing you.

144
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,031
What does that mean?

145
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:32,744
It means that you're... you're blind
to love. You don't even see it.

146
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:35,455
- No, I'm not. I just...
- Yeah.

147
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:36,665
I don't need love.

148
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:38,612
- What?
- You just busted through

149
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:40,418
that potential new couple back there.

150
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:43,004
Yeah, they were about to have a moment,

151
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:44,506
that spark was there,

152
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:47,467
and you lowered your shoulder
and plowed through 'em like a linebacker.

153
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,344
Stop being an idiot, all right?

154
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:51,805
- Oh. Have you been working out?
- I have, yeah.

155
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:54,808
- That's quite hard. Yeah.
- Yeah. I've got an ab-blaster.

156
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:18,289
Hey, Whitney,
can you get me the... Whit?

157
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:20,708
Whit?

158
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:25,296
Um... Can you maybe stop watching
full-length feature films in the office

159
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,549
and just, like, do your job and assist me?

160
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:28,632
Yes, okay.

161
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,553
There are only, like, 43 minutes left,

162
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:33,805
so maybe I'll just stop when it's over
and then do it.

163
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,724
I don't know how it ends.
Do they end up together?

164
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:40,228
This movie ends
like all stupid rom-coms do.

165
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:43,773
The girl gets the guy, and then, finally,
that's what makes her happy.

166
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:46,067
- Pyeow!
- And what's wrong with that?

167
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:48,570
Because she should be happy
with other things in her life,

168
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:51,114
like her great career
that she's worked hard for.

169
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:53,116
It's a romantic comedy.

170
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,075
They're the best.

171
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:55,994
I mean, life can be so sad.

172
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:59,330
I try to wake up smiling, then
I turn on the news and I'm like...

173
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:02,584
And then I turn on
<i>Sweet Home Alabama</i> and I'm like...

174
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:06,921
I mean, have you seen that movie?
It's literally a masterpiece.

175
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:08,715
Masterpiece of shit.

176
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:11,634
Whitney, all those movies are lies,
set to terrible pop songs.

177
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:13,845
I love those songs.
And those movies are not lies.

178
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:14,971
Ah, yes, they are.

179
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:17,557
People waking up in bed
with full hair and makeup.

180
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,017
It's so unrealistic.

181
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,270
Every time someone puts on a pair
of pants, it turns into a whole montage.

182
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:24,105
Yeah, 'cause trying on clothes is fun.

183
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:25,189
For you.

184
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,984
Yeah, what about how
there's always, like, some main chick,

185
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:29,319
and she's super clumsy.

186
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,154
She's always like... "Oh! Whoops!"

187
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,865
And everyone goes, "She's so charming."

188
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:37,994
No. In real life, people'd think
she had muscular dystrophy.

189
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:39,913
Your flaws are what make you beautiful.

190
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:43,666
Uh, your flaws are what make you ugly.
That's why they're called flaws.

191
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,376
And then, like, in those movies,

192
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,300
when there are two women
in the same workplace,

193
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:48,922
they have to be, like, mortal enemies.

194
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:51,382
Look at us. Like, I love you,
I think you're the best.

195
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:54,844
The idea that two women
can't root for each other at work

196
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:55,929
is just disgusting.

197
00:09:56,554 --> 00:10:00,850
And apparently, there's no HR at any
of those businesses in rom-com world,

198
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:02,977
because there's no diversity,

199
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:05,605
and people are always
boning their co-workers.

200
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:08,817
Oh, and don't even get me started
about the cliché gay best friend

201
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:12,821
whose sole purpose in the story
is just to help the main hot chick.

202
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:14,531
And, like, does he have a job?

203
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,450
Like, what's going on in his life?
Who cares?

204
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:19,577
It's so insulting, don't you think?

205
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:22,163
And then they always have
some stupid voiceover

206
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:24,499
that comes on to tell you
what you're supposed to think.

207
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:26,727
You know what I think? Act better.

208
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,503
For someone who hates romantic comedies,

209
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:30,755
you have certainly
thought about this a lot.

210
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:32,483
Okay, don't wait for me.

211
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:35,260
What about how,
at the end of those rom-coms,

212
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:38,721
they always do this stupid, like,
slow motion running sequence?

213
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:41,599
Aah! Aah!

214
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:44,602
And, like, they're trying to break up
a wedding or get their lover back.

215
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:45,728
Well, guess what?

216
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:47,313
He doesn't love you.

217
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:49,691
That's why he's not currently with you
or marrying you.

218
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:52,402
He does love you,
and he's there to complete you.

219
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:55,238
Mind if I come in?
What are we talkin' about?

220
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:58,408
Natalie's been saying
that romantic comedies are bad.

221
00:10:58,491 --> 00:10:59,617
For three hours.

222
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:00,869
Yeah, 'cause they're toxic.

223
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:02,495
Are you kidding me?

224
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:04,706
Have you seen <i>Notting Hill?</i>

225
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:06,457
Have you seen <i>13 Going on 30?</i>

226
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,377
I put those
in my high school time capsule.

227
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,780
- This is a man, I love this man.
- That and my hacky sack.

228
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,423
You two are so soft.

229
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:16,050
You know, she just, uh...
She hates happy endings.

230
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:18,052
Because it's not the end.

231
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:21,598
They stop it there because
what happens next is, like, really shit.

232
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,308
Nobody'll wanna see that.

233
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:25,393
It's unhealthy for little girls
to watch that stuff

234
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:26,978
and think that's how life's gonna be.

235
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:31,858
I think it's nice to be reminded of how
beautiful and full of love life can be.

236
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:32,941
Nope.

237
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:36,654
Hey, so I know you hate it, but it is...

238
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:38,907
<i>♪ Karaoke night ♪</i>

239
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,200
<i>♪ Tonight ♪</i>

240
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:42,911
- When? Uh...
- Tonight. Would you like to come?

241
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:45,330
Or we could do something
less embarrassing,

242
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:47,540
like trampoline nude in public?

243
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:48,875
Okay, well...

244
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:50,960
could've just said no.

245
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:04,265
Um, can I just...
just quickly tell you one more thing

246
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:06,142
that romantic comedies have taught me?

247
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:08,186
- No. No!
- Come on.

248
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,021
Listen to me.

249
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:11,648
- What?
- You're friendzoning Josh.

250
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,691
No I'm not. No. No, no, no.

251
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:15,693
No, Josh doesn't like me like that.

252
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:16,945
You sure about that?

253
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:18,028
Yeah, I'm sure.

254
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:19,906
Do you know how many times
a day I catch him

255
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:23,076
gawking at that half-dressed model
out there?

256
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:26,871
You know, she's like,
"Ooh. Look, I'm so sexy.

257
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:30,250
I just want a man to buy me a salad. Ooh!"

258
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:33,836
You know, but I don't have that,
so that's fine. You know?

259
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,132
I think people would have
an easier time seeing you, Natalie,

260
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:39,676
if you were a little more open.

261
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:21,509
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, t
he train approaching does not stop here.</i>

262
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:23,678
<i>Please stand back from the platform edge.</i>

263
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:25,429
Oh, hey.

264
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:27,223
You get off here too?

265
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:28,766
Oh. Hi.

266
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:30,059
I'm Jack.

267
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:32,645
Natalie. Uh, Nat, like the bug.

268
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:33,980
That's funny.

269
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:38,151
Give me the purse!

270
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,278
- My purse!
- Come on, give it to me!

271
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:44,157
Come on! Give it!

272
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:49,162
Bitch!

273
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:52,165
Oh! Come on, I've got three kids to feed!

274
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:53,688
You look like you've known struggle.

275
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:56,127
Can you help me out? Please?

276
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:59,922
Ha ha, sucker! I don't even have any kids.

277
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,260
Why does this shit always happen to me?

278
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:35,541
Wow. You took quite a spill.

279
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,336
Uh, no. Um...

280
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:43,424
I got mugged by this childless sociopath.

281
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:45,069
We need to call the police,

282
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:47,720
and maybe I should do a sketch,
so I just...

283
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:50,765
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Okay, just slow down, lovely.

284
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:54,060
Where am I?

285
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:55,603
You're in the emergency room.

286
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:58,856
This isn't an emergency room,
this is a Williams-Sonoma.

287
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,484
Okay, sit back, relax.

288
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:02,902
Just let me examine you.

289
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:05,071
Okay.

290
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,201
Oh, dear.

291
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:11,576
What's wrong?

292
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,204
Well, it's your eyes.

293
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:14,872
You're quite beautiful.

294
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:17,250
Did I die?

295
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:21,337
You are, like, way too hot to be a doctor,
and saying really creepy things to me.

296
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:23,464
I am so enjoying my time with you.

297
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:25,591
- Why?
- Yeah.

298
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:26,843
Wait. I know what's going on.

299
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,366
You're working with that subway guy.

300
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:31,055
First he knocks me out,
and then you try to steal my kidneys!

301
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:33,724
- What?
- Security! Please, I need help!

302
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:35,088
Well, if you really wanna leave,

303
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:37,687
I'm sorry to say that your clothes
were completely ruined.

304
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,898
But don't worry. We picked some things out
from the lost and found for you.

305
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:52,952
Josh, um, can you call me?

306
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,745
I was mugged and I don't...

307
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:57,293
I don't know,
maybe I was harvested for my eggs.

308
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:59,459
I don't know.
Please, um, just call me back, okay?

309
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:01,878
Hey, pretty woman.

310
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:03,462
Good morning.

311
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:04,921
Oh.

312
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:11,220
Love your outfit.

313
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:12,929
Very chic.

314
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:22,899
This is really weird.

315
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:24,942
<i>- ♪ Makin' my way downtown ♪</i>
- Oh!

316
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:30,490
- Good God! Are you okay?
- Aaah!

317
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:32,992
You... What the...

318
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:34,368
I am so sorry.

319
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:36,537
My driver was probably distracted by you.

320
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:40,082
Wow, you're...
you're quite beguiling, aren't you?

321
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,084
Why are you now Australian?

322
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:44,879
- I'm Australian, so it comes out that way.
- No, no, no.

323
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:46,881
You weren't Australian this morning

324
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:49,364
when you saw my cup of whipped cream
with a dollop of coffee.

325
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:51,636
I find it impossible to believe
that we've met before

326
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:54,222
- and I don't remember you.
- Oh, what's going on?

327
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:55,932
Are you okay?

328
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,850
No! Don't you smell what's happening?

329
00:16:57,934 --> 00:16:59,977
New York doesn't smell like shit anymore.

330
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:01,771
Everything smells like lavender.

331
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,356
I think you might have hit your head.

332
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:06,692
Why don't we check you in at the doctor,
maybe? Or just take you home?

333
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,945
Something is really wrong.

334
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,488
Okay, well, why don't you, um...

335
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:13,392
Why don't you let me take you home?
I'm not gonna hurt you.

336
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,284
Let's... Let's get you home, though.

337
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:17,119
I'll give you a ride, okay?

338
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,580
Champagne and strawberries.

339
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,877
Dom Pérignon once said
it was like tasting the stars.

340
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:26,754
Did you know he was a monk?

341
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:29,715
And we're here.

342
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:32,134
What? How...
how did we get here so fast?

343
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:33,803
That was, like, 18 seconds.

344
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:43,688
Someone's really cleaned up the street.

345
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,150
Those wedding dresses.

346
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:49,944
Those weren't there before.

347
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:52,655
And who put all these flowers everywhere?

348
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:54,991
Ooh, bless you.

349
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,368
Oh, doubles, double blessings.

350
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:59,787
Oh, three times! That's lucky.

351
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:00,955
Oh, I'm allergic.

352
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:03,475
You sure I can't get you something?
Maybe a hanky or a tissue?

353
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,793
I think I just, erm... I need to lie down.

354
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:08,254
I'll be...
I'll be totally fine then.

355
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:09,880
- Okay.
- Erm... Uh...

356
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:10,965
Thank you, I just...

357
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:14,594
I have no idea
why you're being so nice to me. I just...

358
00:18:15,553 --> 00:18:18,014
I don't get it, but thanks.

359
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:19,973
Well, erm...

360
00:18:21,142 --> 00:18:22,142
Hold on a second.

361
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:29,066
If you need anything,

362
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,150
anything at all...

363
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:35,281
don't hesitate to...

364
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:39,368
give me a call on my cellular...

365
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:41,454
telephone... device.

366
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:43,039
Yeah. That's my number.

367
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,125
That's very charming.

368
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,918
But you do realize there's, like...

369
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:52,173
3.6 million permutations
of how this could go together?

370
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,175
But there's only one you, so...

371
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:57,136
Right. That doesn't really make sense.

372
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,973
Neither does the way
I'm feelin' about you right now.

373
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,183
But, uh...

374
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:04,393
That still doesn't change
the math, though.

375
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:06,937
Just to be clear, I cannot call you.

376
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:08,481
Are you feeling what I'm feeling?

377
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:09,607
No!

378
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:10,940
Call me!

379
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:15,279
Josh, I'm not kidding, can you call me?

380
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:18,949
Did you set this all up
because I didn't go to karaoke with you?

381
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,682
Oh, sorry.

382
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:45,226
I just walked into the wrong apartment.
Leav... Leaving.

383
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:46,894
Sorry.

384
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,042
Oh.

385
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:16,799
Thank you. These are lovely.

386
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:21,095
Holy shit.

387
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:25,057
Okay, you can come out now...

388
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:27,184
Whatever reality show this is.

389
00:20:27,268 --> 00:20:28,561
You guys win!

390
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,230
I'm gonna love it, not list it. Pfft.

391
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:34,567
Hello?

392
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:36,736
Baxter?

393
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:38,946
Baxter, come here, pups. Come here.

394
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:40,781
Is that you, Baxter?

395
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,284
Pyeoo!

396
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,832
You've never done that before.

397
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:55,337
- 911, what's your emergency?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

398
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:57,339
I've, erm, been robbed, sort of.

399
00:20:58,007 --> 00:20:59,367
Someone's broken into my apartment

400
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:01,302
and... stretched it.

401
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:04,096
And they've taken everything and...

402
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,307
replaced it all with much nicer stuff.

403
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,476
Okay, ma'am,
this doesn't sound like an emergency.

404
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,519
This sounds like you've got it together.

405
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:17,234
<i>Ma'am, are you there?</i>

406
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:19,820
This is every pair of shoes ever made.

407
00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:22,948
I don't normally wear heels
because of the uneven weight distribution,

408
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:25,576
but these are incredible.

409
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:28,704
And they're... they're all in my size.

410
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:30,164
<i>So let me get this straight.</i>

411
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:32,374
Your emergency is that
your apartment is too big,

412
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,058
you have every shoe you could ever want,

413
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:35,753
and they all fit your cute feet.

414
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:37,797
- Yeah, exactly, that's what I...
- Bye.

415
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:45,387
- Why are we screaming?
- Donny!

416
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:47,014
How did you get in here?

417
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:50,476
Someone said "Gay Beetlejuice" three
times, and then I magically appeared.

418
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:51,936
How do you think I got in here?

419
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:55,439
With the key you gave me,
'cause I'm your favorite neighbor.

420
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:56,723
Why are you talking like that?

421
00:21:56,774 --> 00:21:58,609
Erm, talking like what?

422
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:00,444
Like an offensive version of a gay guy.

423
00:22:00,528 --> 00:22:03,113
Miss Girl Thing Bouffant, please.

424
00:22:03,197 --> 00:22:04,782
You sound and look like an alien

425
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:06,510
who's faking being gay.

426
00:22:06,534 --> 00:22:08,014
Oh, my God!
Pop a Tic Tac and move it!

427
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:11,539
You've gotta get to work
to get crackin' on that big presentation!

428
00:22:11,622 --> 00:22:13,749
- What presentation?
- Um, I don't know.

429
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:14,917
The big presentation.

430
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,086
Which is what my boyfriend calls me
in the sack, PS.

431
00:22:18,212 --> 00:22:20,047
Okay, booch,
change out of whatever this is.

432
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:23,968
I'm gonna drop you off at the office
on the way to my no plans whatsoever!

433
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:26,512
Oh!

434
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:28,639
I love you so much.

435
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:31,392
Can you hear me when I say that?

436
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:32,726
How about now?

Erm, if I had a job, yeah.

00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:45,447

Hey, Nat. Let me lighten your load
and grab that for you.

446
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:06,886
Oh, uh, I wasn't fully done with that...

447
00:23:06,969 --> 00:23:09,638
Hey, Natalie, your 3D printer
was running a little bit slow,

448
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:11,802
so I had IT come by
and step it up for you, you know?

449
00:23:11,849 --> 00:23:13,049
Just preventative maintenance.

450
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,518
Oh, you had something fixed for me.

451
00:23:14,602 --> 00:23:17,146
Yeah, I'm the office manager
and you're the star architect.

452
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:18,814
How else would it be, silly?

453
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,443
Oh, Whitney...

454
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,988
Oh, er... Wow, you look
really, really different.

455
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:28,908
Erm, you have to explain to me
what on earth is going on here.

456
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:32,620
I don't have to explain shit to you.
I don't work for you.

457
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,915
Technically, you...
Actually, you're my assistant, so...

458
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:37,499
I know you, you know...

459
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:41,420
I don't like to say "I'm the boss!"
or anything, but, uh, you're my assistant.

460
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:44,131
That's literally the funniest thing
I've ever heard.

461
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:45,925
- What?
- Me working for you.

462
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,761
Let me put it in terms
that you can understand.

463
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:51,263
You're going down, bitch.

464
00:24:02,358 --> 00:24:03,233
- Natalie!
- Oh!

465
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:05,653
Oh, I scared you so bad.

466
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,404
What's up? I got your message.

467
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:08,906
Thank God, you're still you.

468
00:24:09,323 --> 00:24:10,741
Okay. Okay, normal.

469
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:12,576
Yep, yeah, normal Josh.

470
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,161
Okay, I really need your help.

471
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:16,246
What's goin' on?

472
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:17,790
I got mugged last night.

473
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:19,541
And suddenly, my apartment is tits,

474
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:22,753
and my neighbor Donny is setting
gay rights back, like, a hundred years.

475
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:24,880
And Whitney is giving me
resting murder face.

476
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:26,006
Nat, are you okay?

477
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:29,760
No, my dog is now clean
and guys look at me in the eyes.

478
00:24:30,928 --> 00:24:32,805
- See?
- Hey, guys.

479
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:35,307
I think that's a good thing though, right?

480
00:24:35,391 --> 00:24:38,519
Uh... Maybe in theory, but this is
some kind of parallel universe.

481
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:40,396
This isn't our office.

482
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:41,897
Josh, it's not.

483
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:43,482
Look, it's not real.

484
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:45,317
I think I might be going crazy.

485
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:48,487
Hey, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Come on.

486
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:53,826
Hey, it's okay.

487
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:57,037
You... You're a lot of things,
but you are not crazy.

488
00:24:57,121 --> 00:24:58,122
So...

489
00:24:58,205 --> 00:24:59,623
So you see it, too.

490
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:02,668
Oh! Yeah, thank God.

491
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:05,337
I think we should get out of here
before they bite us

492
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:07,923
- or impregnate us...
- Okay, yeah. Let's get you some air.

493
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:09,717
No one's gonna impregnate us. Come on.

494
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:13,762
See?
Doesn't this all feel really weird?

495
00:25:14,138 --> 00:25:16,932
Okay, you have to calm down, okay?

496
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:19,309
Just... Just take a breath

497
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:21,228
of this sweet, sweet, New York air.

498
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:26,984
Okay, you're still looking at me
like I'm crazy.

499
00:25:27,735 --> 00:25:30,446
Please, just don't commit me
to some super beautiful insane asylum.

500
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:31,989
I don't think you're crazy.

501
00:25:32,406 --> 00:25:34,116
But what you were telling me is...

502
00:25:34,742 --> 00:25:36,368
a little cuckoo.

503
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:39,079
But since you are the one saying it,
I believe you.

504
00:25:39,163 --> 00:25:40,581
- I'll help you, okay?
- Okay.

505
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:41,790
Let's figure this out.

506
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:44,793
All right, well, maybe if I retrace
my steps

507
00:25:44,877 --> 00:25:47,212
from last night, we could...

508
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:49,173
Is that woman choking?

509
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:51,717
No, she's just being dramatic.

510
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,010
I choke all the time.

511
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:54,493
You know when you put those candies

512
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:56,953
- in the back of your mouth and...
- Sh, sh, sh, sh.

513
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:59,224
Josh?

514
00:25:59,308 --> 00:26:00,976
- Josh?
- Stand up, stand up.

515
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,144
Hey, Josh?

516
00:26:05,314 --> 00:26:06,565
Is that really necessary?

517
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,778
Okay. She's okay.

518
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:18,993
Hi.

519
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:20,536
Hi.

520
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:22,623
You saved my life.

521
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,374
I can't thank you enough.

522
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:26,835
Josh.

523
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:28,504
That is such a beautiful name.

524
00:26:29,338 --> 00:26:31,090
Josssssh.

525
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:34,009
I like how you say it. Josh!

526
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:36,095
I don't know.
I think it's kinda... ordinary.

527
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:37,054
No.

528
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:38,847
I love ordinary.

529
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:39,807
- You do?
- Yes.

530
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:42,017
Okay, well, I am a very ordinary guy.

531
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:44,269
I am a seven across the board.

532
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:45,687
That's perfect.

533
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:47,189
Oh, so...

534
00:26:48,482 --> 00:26:51,193
What do you do?
That's a thing an ordinary guy would ask.

535
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:52,653
I'm a yoga ambassador.

536
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:54,363
Namaste.

537
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:55,446
Namaste.

538
00:26:55,823 --> 00:26:58,033
But my real job is...
I'm a swimsuit model.

539
00:26:58,117 --> 00:27:01,120
- That makes sense.
- But really, I'm a role model.

540
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:03,831
Because I believe in giving back
to the underprivileged.

541
00:27:03,914 --> 00:27:05,207
I'm underprivileged.

542
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,751
- All right! Oh! Oh, hey!
- You're so...

543
00:27:07,835 --> 00:27:09,086
- Hey!
- You're so funny!

544
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:12,464
Oh, oh. Sorry. Hey.
This is my best friend, Natalie.

545
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:13,966
Natalie, this is...

546
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,069
- Isabella Stone.
- You're from the...

547
00:27:16,093 --> 00:27:17,427
- Hi.
- You're from the billboard.

548
00:27:17,511 --> 00:27:19,429
- You are?
- You are from the billboard.

549
00:27:19,513 --> 00:27:21,890
- So who are you?
- Natalie.

550
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:23,350
Good to meet you. Um, I... I...

551
00:27:23,934 --> 00:27:26,436
I don't...
I can't believe I'm gonna do this, but...

552
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:29,731
Would a man like you ever...

553
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:31,775
have a drink with a girl like me?

554
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:36,029
Oh, let me think about it.

555
00:27:37,698 --> 00:27:39,700
Yes. I will meet you back at the office.

556
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:40,826
- Really?
- Yeah.

557
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:41,994
- Wait.
- Okay, great.

558
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:43,138
- Let me get my bag.
- Josh.

559
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:44,997
- Technically, you almost died.
- Yeah, I did.

560
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,225
- You saved me.
- Josh? Josh? We have to make the plan.

561
00:27:47,249 --> 00:27:48,959
I just wanna make sure she's okay.

562
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:50,043
She's fine.

563
00:27:50,127 --> 00:27:52,045
She... She's laughing, she's fine.

564
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:54,756
Yeah, and also, you don't know her.

565
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,968
Why not be open to something new, right?

566
00:27:58,677 --> 00:27:59,678
See ya.

567
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:04,474
Er... er...

568
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:07,935
Hey.

569
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:10,189
Oh, I'm so... I'm sorry. I... Uh...

570
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:11,982
- You must think I'm...
- Adorable.

571
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:20,449
Okay, get a grip.

572
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:21,950
Let's just think about this.

573
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:26,496
I have an amazing apartment
and a super cute dog.

574
00:28:27,164 --> 00:28:28,457
A gay sidekick.

575
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:31,460
I have a great job,
but the only woman that works with me

576
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:32,783
has now become my mortal enemy.

577
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:34,087
Oh!

578
00:28:34,171 --> 00:28:37,216
I keep falling down all the time.

579
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:39,885
And I'm talking to myself out loud.

580
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:44,640
I think I'm trapped in a...

581
00:28:48,185 --> 00:28:50,646
My life has become a...

582
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:53,690
Come on!

583
00:28:53,774 --> 00:28:55,651
What did I do to deserve this?

584
00:28:56,193 --> 00:28:58,820
My life's become a...

585
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:00,821
...romantic comedy!

586
00:29:05,953 --> 00:29:08,497
And it's... PG-13!

587
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:19,925
Excuse me. I need your help.

588
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:21,888
I need the surveillance footage
from last night,

589
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:24,930
so I can find my mugger,
so that, um, he can fight me a little bit,

590
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:26,098
knock me unconscious,

591
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:29,851
and then I can leave
this unbearable romantic world.

592
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:32,604
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
You sound crazy as hell.

593
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:33,688
Please.

594
00:29:34,231 --> 00:29:36,149
I just need access
to the surveillance footage.

595
00:29:36,233 --> 00:29:37,752
Well, you ain't getting
the surveillance footage.

596
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:39,816
- Why not?
- Get away from me. You're crazy as hell.

597
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,707
Hey! Oh...

598
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:52,790
- Hi.
- Erm...

599
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:55,085
Hey. Erm...

600
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:56,878
Can you please mug me?

601
00:29:56,962 --> 00:29:59,047
Yeah, just go for it,
and drag me around for a while,

602
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:00,691
and then I'll knock myself unconscious.

603
00:30:00,716 --> 00:30:02,092
Mother warned me.

604
00:30:02,551 --> 00:30:04,469
- No. What? No...
- Excuse me.

605
00:30:04,553 --> 00:30:06,096
Oh! It's easy!

606
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:07,899
You! You look like
you're prone to violence.

607
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:09,558
Come on, mug me.

608
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:10,743
- What? No!
- Yeah, like that.

609
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:13,228
I'll go, like, "Shitbag,"
and then I'll knock myself cold.

610
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:15,355
What? What's wrong with everybody?

611
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:16,690
Look at you guys!

612
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:18,400
This isn't real!

613
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:21,570
Oh, I hate this place. I hate this place!

614
00:30:22,863 --> 00:30:24,340
It's too... delightful!

615
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:26,283
<i>This train is not stopping</i>

616
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:27,784
<i>- at the station.</i>
<i>- </i>Okay, fine!

617
00:30:27,868 --> 00:30:29,745
If nobody wants to hit me...

618
00:30:34,124 --> 00:30:37,294
...then maybe this will knock me back
to my dull, ordinary life.

619
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:57,898
Officer Hansom?

620
00:30:58,774 --> 00:30:59,775
I didn't wanna be saved.

621
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,234
I'm not saving you.

622
00:31:01,318 --> 00:31:03,320
- I'm arresting you.
- What for?

623
00:31:04,321 --> 00:31:05,489
Jumping the turnstile.

624
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:07,032
Let's go.

625
00:31:09,743 --> 00:31:11,244
My hands are right on your junk.

626
00:31:12,621 --> 00:31:13,705
This way.

627
00:31:14,623 --> 00:31:16,976
- There's your phone, Princess.
- Erm, give me my cell phone

628
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,168
so I can type the number in.

629
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:20,313
- You've gotta use this phone.
- You're kidding, right?

630
00:31:20,337 --> 00:31:22,631
I don't know anybody's numbers
off by heart.

631
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:24,591
- Pretend it's 1995.
- Great.

632
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:28,011
I can call my dead nana
or the house I lived in when I was 12.

633
00:31:28,095 --> 00:31:29,679
One call, time's tickin'.

634
00:31:29,763 --> 00:31:31,807
All right, I'm thinking, I'm thinking.

635
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:35,685
If you need anything, anything at all,
here is my number.

636
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:37,396
All right?

637
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:39,021
Oh.

638
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:41,858
This probably won't work.

639
00:31:42,526 --> 00:31:46,822
Unless you believe in the power of love
or some bullshit, but it's worth a try.

640
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:47,906
Here goes.

641
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,420
Oh.

642
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:11,346
<i>Y'ello, Blake speaking.</i>

643
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:12,556
So dumb!

644
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:15,475
Erm, thanks for coming to get me.

645
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:17,811
Are you kidding?
I was so excited to hear from you.

646
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:20,414
I mean, even though it was
to bail you out of jail. Pretty cool.

647
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:22,524
Normally, I'd be so excited to hear

648
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:25,861
that someone like you is so excited
to hear from someone like me, but...

649
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:28,864
Tell me what's goin' on. I'm a good
listener, I've got very big earholes.

650
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:31,199
I can't. You'd... you'd have me committed.

651
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:34,244
Come on, you can tell me
anything you want, anything at all.

652
00:32:35,162 --> 00:32:37,497
Except that you think koalas
are the cutest things ever.

653
00:32:37,581 --> 00:32:39,875
They have chlamydia
and are actually quite hostile,

654
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,710
so stay away from 'em, all right?

655
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:43,211
Anyway, let's hear it.

656
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:45,422
Okay.

657
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:47,007
I hit my head really hard...

658
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:50,677
and I woke up in this alternate universe.

659
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,595
Okay.

660
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:54,055
And things are supposed to be better,

661
00:32:54,139 --> 00:32:58,852
but it's actually worse because people
are treating me like I'm special.

662
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:00,102
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

663
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,148
And I'm not special.

664
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:08,445
Still waters run deepest, don't they?

665
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:09,528
What?

666
00:33:09,738 --> 00:33:12,032
God, there's so much more
I wanna know about you.

667
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:13,867
No, see, you're not understanding.

668
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,285
This isn't a real world.

669
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:18,330
This is, like, the Matrix
for lonely women.

670
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:23,519
Hold that thought.
It's my father calling from Singapore.

671
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:24,753
You know how it is.

672
00:33:27,923 --> 00:33:29,424
I have to get out of here.

673
00:33:29,883 --> 00:33:32,427
How do I get to the end?

674
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:36,181
<i>I was beginning to wonder</i>

675
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:38,391
<i>if there was another way
out of this world.</i>

676
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,894
<i>If I was in a romantic comedy, then...</i>

677
00:33:41,645 --> 00:33:43,980
<i>maybe I needed someone
to fall in love with me.</i>

678
00:33:50,946 --> 00:33:51,946
Fine.

679
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:55,575
If I have to do this,

680
00:33:55,659 --> 00:33:58,245
I guess it could be worse
than a super hot billionaire.

681
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:03,750
Natalie, I am so sorry, but, uh...
I have to run back to the office

682
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,919
- and put out some fires.
- Oh.

683
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:07,837
Whooosh!

684
00:34:07,921 --> 00:34:10,966
But, erm... why don't you do me a favor,

685
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:13,885
and, uh, have dinner with me later, okay?

686
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:15,262
I'll send a car for you.

687
00:34:15,345 --> 00:34:17,556
Great. That'd be... wonderful.

688
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:19,599
Great!

689
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:22,394
I'll see you later.

690
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,565
That was easy enough.

691
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:30,986
Oh, wa... Oh, wait, hang on, what time?

692
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:33,405
And what... what should I wear?

693
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:35,328
I need to...
What's the name of the restaurant?

694
00:34:35,407 --> 00:34:36,950
I like to look it up before,

695
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:39,160
so I can decide what I want from the menu!

696
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:42,581
And do they even have
a dessert selection? Wait!

697
00:34:44,124 --> 00:34:45,625
Okay, what am I gonna wear?

698
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,920
Can't dob it up like I do on the usual.

699
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:51,506
Oh, I know who'll know.

700
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:56,595
- Donny?
- Yes?

701
00:34:56,678 --> 00:34:58,597
- Jesus!
- No.

702
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,480
But I'd love to turn water
into a pinot grig'.

703
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:02,726
So, what's the update?

704
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:05,979
Er, I have to go on a date
with that big, fancy Blake guy,

705
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:07,731
and, um... make him fall in love with me.

706
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:08,898
What?

707
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:12,902
Are you serious? Oh, my God!

708
00:35:12,986 --> 00:35:14,487
Oh, my God!

709
00:35:14,571 --> 00:35:16,197
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

710
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:18,241
Oh, my God. Okay. Okay.

711
00:35:18,325 --> 00:35:20,827
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

712
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:23,079
I'm so happy for you.

713
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:25,123
Oh, my God. Oh. This is it.

714
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:27,304
Oh, my God, this is it,
this is the moment.

715
00:35:27,334 --> 00:35:29,395
This is the moment
I've been training for my entire life.

716
00:35:29,419 --> 00:35:31,338
Okay...

717
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,424
Where is that music... Oh, no.

718
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:38,345
Okay. I think we're being dragged
into some dumb makeover montage.

719
00:35:38,428 --> 00:35:39,804
You wanna do a makeover montage?

720
00:35:39,888 --> 00:35:42,432
No, no. I hate trying on clothes.

721
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:45,560
Oh, my God, yes,
we should definitely try on clothes.

722
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:47,004
I'm not trying on different things

723
00:35:47,062 --> 00:35:49,356
and coming out and going,
"What do you think?"

724
00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:51,775
No! No! No!

725
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:15,714
Wow.

726
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:21,596
Natalie, you look beautiful.

727
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,765
No, I just threw this together.

728
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:27,477
Just... It only took, like, five hours.

729
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:31,856
To the forces of destiny
that brought us together tonight.

730
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:35,652
Well, you invited me
and sent the car, so...

731
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:39,489
That's... that's very sweet, though.

732
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:40,572

but he was kind enough
to cook us dinner tonight.

Well, thank you.

Ah, funny, my Fitbit sometimes vibrates
and says, "Wanna stroll?"

All right, what's your favorite

- Butter pecan.

- Right.
- Okay.

What's your second favorite
ice-cream flavor?

789
00:38:55,792 --> 00:38:56,792
Rum raisin.

790

- No! That's even worse.
- Yeah. I know.

00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:04,384
- Ah.
- In grade school I was teased about it

793
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:07,470
so mercilessly that I went a solid decade

794
00:39:07,554 --> 00:39:10,181
where I only ate ice cream
in the privacy of my own home.

795
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:13,309
I can just imagine you
sitting at home, like...

796
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:15,687
- Yep.
- "Mm, butter pecan."

797
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:17,230
Underneath the bed.

798
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:19,983
You know, the Buddhists say...

799
00:39:20,817 --> 00:39:22,235
that if you meet someone...

800
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:25,488
and your heart pounds

801
00:39:25,572 --> 00:39:27,699
and your hands shake
and your knees go weak,

802
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:29,701
that that's not the one.

803
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:33,580
When you meet your soulmate,
you'll feel completely calm.

804
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:36,958
<i>♪ Do-be-do-be-do-do-do ♪</i>

805
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:38,543
<i>♪ Oh ♪</i>

806
00:39:40,587 --> 00:39:42,255
I feel very calm right now.

807
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:43,381
How about you?

808
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:48,511
I feel like we're about to get arrested.

809
00:39:48,595 --> 00:39:50,221
Yep, we should probably go.

810
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:57,812
I had an amazing time tonight.

811
00:39:58,897 --> 00:40:00,899
So did I.

812
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:04,402
I'm just, like...
I've never had a night like this before.

813
00:40:04,736 --> 00:40:05,736
Oh!

814
00:40:07,447 --> 00:40:09,365
Oh...

815
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:13,077
Rain. Hah!

816
00:40:13,161 --> 00:40:15,038
Really? That's so cliché...

817
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:25,548
Normally, I'd call bullshit on this...

818
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:38,603
I know this might sound crazy...

819
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:40,166
- Yeah.
...'cause we've only just met,

820
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:42,398
- but I love...
- Whoa!

821
00:40:42,482 --> 00:40:45,401
No, no, no, no, don't.
Don't say anything yet.

822
00:40:45,485 --> 00:40:47,278
I can't go back to real life without...

823
00:40:48,071 --> 00:40:50,271
- What do you mean? Without what?
- Without, you know...

824
00:40:52,075 --> 00:40:53,076
- Oh.
- Yeah.

825
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:54,202
Oh, God.

826
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:55,662
Oh...

827

Good morning, beautiful.

830
00:41:06,631 --> 00:41:07,966
Last night was amazing.

831
00:41:08,508 --> 00:41:10,194
You know,
I was just thinking in the shower,

832
00:41:10,218 --> 00:41:12,679
when I look at the world
through your eyes,

833
00:41:12,762 --> 00:41:14,764
it's like I'm seeing it
for the first time.

834
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:15,723
Natalie, I love...

835
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:18,559
Wait, wait, wait. Erm, hold that thought,
don't say another word.

836
00:41:18,643 --> 00:41:20,687
Just... Just get back into bed.

837
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:22,522
I don't think we actually did anything.

838
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:24,208
- It just cut to the next morning.
- What?

839
00:41:24,232 --> 00:41:25,232
Just get back here.

840
00:41:25,692 --> 00:41:26,776
Okay.

857
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:08,901
If I can't have sex, I'm at least
taking this nice purse with me.

858
00:42:09,986 --> 00:42:11,821
This little koala thing,
it looks expensive.

859
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:14,115
Yeah, all right, give it to me.

860
00:42:15,158 --> 00:42:16,158
Natalie...

861
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:18,703
I love you.

00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:24,709
Er... Can you just say that one more time?

864
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:25,877
- What?
- Er...

865
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,837
You know how us girls are.

866
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:31,299
We love hearin' it.
Just say it. Say it again.

867
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:32,382
Natalie...

868
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:35,636

you.

871
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:43,394
Mo...

872
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:48,649
Thank you so much.
I've been looking for one of those.

873
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:56,490
Well, check you out.

874
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:58,326
Oh. Whitney.

875
00:42:58,409 --> 00:42:59,409
Whoa, check you out.

876
00:42:59,452 --> 00:43:01,204
Ballsy move not showing up to work

877
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:03,748
the entire week
before the big presentation.

878
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:06,334
This seems incredibly unnecessary, okay?

879
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:09,646
Just 'cause we're two female colleagues,
we don't automatically have to be enemies.

880
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:11,339
We marched together, remember?

881
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:15,301
We had that great sign. Girls Just Wanna
Have Fun-damental Human Rights.

882
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:17,594
Whitney?

883
00:43:18,346 --> 00:43:20,765
Whitney, what are you doing?
We're friends.

884
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:23,017
Whitney, come on, we shared a T-shirt.

885
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:26,062
And I stretched it out and you said,
"You can have that one now."

886
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:27,355
I was like, "Score."

887
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:34,362
Natalie, we're so glad you're here.

888
00:43:35,404 --> 00:43:37,240
- Oh.
- So, we have three days

889
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:38,658
before the presentation.

890
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:40,868
Give us your big idea for the hotel.

891
00:43:40,952 --> 00:43:43,871
But I... I... I don't, erm...
design the whole hotels.

892
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:46,040
I normally, erm,
just do the parking garages.

893
00:43:46,124 --> 00:43:48,668
You're our star architect,
come on.

894
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:49,669
Give us your vision.

895
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:51,796
I do... I don't really have a... erm...

896
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:52,880
She's got nothing.

897
00:43:53,798 --> 00:43:54,882
Erm...

898
00:43:56,676 --> 00:43:57,844
It's a surprise.

899
00:43:57,927 --> 00:43:58,803
Yeah.

900
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:01,264
And you're saving the best

901
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:03,474
for the actual presentation,
and I applaud that.

902
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:06,018
- Whoo! Natalie!
- Yeah!

903
00:44:06,102 --> 00:44:07,979
Comin' through with it...

904
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:09,147
Natalie!

905
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:37,133
It's open.

906
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:39,427
Since when do you use
the doorbell, Donny?

907
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:41,387
Hey.

908
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:44,640
So, figured you're probably workin'
so hard you forgot to eat.

909
00:44:44,724 --> 00:44:46,809
I got us a little Mister Wongs.

910
00:44:47,852 --> 00:44:50,605
Oh, my God, I'm starving. I love you.

911
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:53,065
So...

912
00:44:53,149 --> 00:44:55,568
show me what you've been workin' on.

913
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:59,197
Erm... Okay, do you remember
that parking garage idea?

914
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:00,823
- Erm...
- Uh-huh.

915
00:45:00,907 --> 00:45:01,907
Erm...

916
00:45:02,909 --> 00:45:04,160
I just kind of ran with it.

917
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:06,329
Nat, this is so like you.

918
00:45:06,412 --> 00:45:09,498
Hm... To waste so much time
on a dumb idea.

919
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:11,834
No.

920
00:45:11,918 --> 00:45:15,755
No, to come up with, like, the best,
most original idea, just like that.

921
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:17,632
Clearly, you don't need my help,

922
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:19,300
so I'll... I'll just be leavin'.

923
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:20,760
Uh, no, don't go.

924
00:45:20,843 --> 00:45:22,723
I could...
I could really use your help on this.

925
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:24,430
And...

926
00:45:24,513 --> 00:45:27,225
you know, er... use your company.

927
00:45:27,308 --> 00:45:30,144
Thank God, because I really want
those soup dumplings.

928
00:45:30,228 --> 00:45:31,229
No way! They're mine!

929
00:45:31,312 --> 00:45:33,356
- You just said you brought them for me!
- Oh, okay.

930
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:34,690
Oh!

931
00:45:34,774 --> 00:45:36,359
Ever seen <i>Friends?</i>

932
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:38,027
They don't fight over soup dumplings.

933
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:39,904
They share them, okay?

934
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:40,987
Here.

935
00:45:41,322 --> 00:45:44,992
- Oh... Mm! They smell so good.
- Mm! So does this.

936
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:47,495
Uh...

937
00:45:48,037 --> 00:45:49,117
I should go get cleaned up.

938
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:52,541
I was just in the subway.
I might have Zika virus or something.

939
00:45:52,625 --> 00:45:53,625
Is that still a thing?

940
00:45:53,668 --> 00:45:56,504
<i>I was beginning to wonder
if I've gotten it all wrong.</i>

941
00:45:56,963 --> 00:45:59,757
<i>Maybe it wasn't Blake
who needed to fall in love with me.</i>

942
00:46:00,633 --> 00:46:02,677
<i>And do I look cute in these side braids?</i>

943
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:03,844
You say somethin'?

944
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:09,225
I can't...

945
00:46:09,308 --> 00:46:11,560
Aren't you supposed
to be hanging out with her?

946
00:46:11,644 --> 00:46:14,063
I can't understand you
'cause your mouth is full.

947
00:46:14,647 --> 00:46:17,108
Look at these. They're incredible.

948
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:18,191
Mm!

949
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:20,653
Mmmm!

950
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:22,947
Mm! Mm!

951
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:24,323
Oh, my God, okay.

952
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:26,742
- You sound like you're having a...
- Mmm!

953
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:32,456
Don't. No, stop it!

954
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:33,541
You're such an idiot!

955
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,042
Stop it.

956
00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:36,210
Ohhhh...

957
00:46:36,294 --> 00:46:38,587
Oh, my God.

958
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:40,589
I'll have what he's having.

959
00:46:40,673 --> 00:46:43,509
- Yummo!
- Blake, what is...

960
00:46:43,592 --> 00:46:45,511
Is he helping you
with your project too? That...

961
00:46:46,304 --> 00:46:48,889
That does seem cool, since
he's the one that makes the decision.

962
00:46:48,973 --> 00:46:51,517
Oh, are you guys together? I didn't know.

963
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,520
I should've...
I was gonna say something earlier.

964
00:46:53,561 --> 00:46:54,979
We just... erm...

965
00:46:56,272 --> 00:46:58,524
I've just been, erm,
seeing Blake a little bit.

966
00:46:58,607 --> 00:47:00,985
- You didn't tell me?
- Come on. Don't undersell it, babe.

967
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:02,987
I love this beguiling woman.

968
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:05,281
- I love you.
- Ah...

969
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:08,159
Dumplings!

970
00:47:10,745 --> 00:47:13,080
Well, you know, I don't wanna be the...

971
00:47:13,581 --> 00:47:16,042
third wheel here, so I'm gonna get goin'.

972
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:17,959
Enjoy the food.

973
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:21,213
Ah.

974
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:23,506
He seems sweet.

975
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:29,013
Someone should tell him not to wear
a brown belt with black shoes, though.

976
00:47:29,638 --> 00:47:30,638
It's tacky.

977
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:43,176
Natalie, have you ever heard
of a man called Gandhi?

978
00:47:43,235 --> 00:47:44,904
Erm... Yes.

979
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:47,907
He once said that true happiness

980
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:51,744
was when what you think,
what you say, and what you do

981
00:47:51,827 --> 00:47:53,245
are in perfect harmony.

982
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:55,164
Isn't that great?

983
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:57,917
Yeah, it's so cool you know
all these sayings by heart, Blake.

984
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,085
Yeah, well, it's a gift.

985
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:05,256
Josh?

986
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:07,968
And choking supermodel.

987
00:48:08,052 --> 00:48:10,096
Choking yoga ambassador, actually.

988
00:48:10,179 --> 00:48:11,514
- That's not a real thing.
- Hey.

989
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:13,391
So, here, let me introduce you. Isabella.

990
00:48:13,474 --> 00:48:14,683
- Hi.
- Izzie!

991
00:48:14,767 --> 00:48:16,185
Blake, how are you?

992
00:48:16,268 --> 00:48:18,813
I was gonna introduce you
but you know... know each other. Okay.

993
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:19,956
- Yeah!
- You didn't tell me

994
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:21,816
the guy you were seeing
was Nat's assistant.

995
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:24,026
- Stop. He's an architect.
- Oh...

996
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:26,362
- Well, project manager.
- Architect.

997
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:27,947
He... seems soft.

998
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:29,281
He is.

999
00:48:29,365 --> 00:48:31,742
Oh, my God, how did you know
I called him Mush?

1000
00:48:32,368 --> 00:48:35,871
Mush, you have to do
that thing that I love, when you do.

1001
00:48:35,955 --> 00:48:37,195
- Uh...
- Come on. Do it.

1002
00:48:37,248 --> 00:48:39,208
- Maybe not right now.
- Do it. Do it, do it!

1003
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:40,167
Okay.

1004
00:48:40,251 --> 00:48:41,293
Oh, look at that!

1005
00:48:41,377 --> 00:48:43,129
There's so much of it!

1006
00:48:43,212 --> 00:48:44,296
I'm a little mushball.

1007
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:46,215
- Cute!
- Just... She loves my neck fat.

1008
00:48:46,298 --> 00:48:47,818
I just... You know, I love cake, so...

1009
00:48:47,842 --> 00:48:50,511
So, how do you two know each other?

1010
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:52,596
- Oh, Blake and I?
- Uh, let me guess.

1011
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:55,516
You guys met at some fabulous yacht party.

1012
00:48:56,934 --> 00:48:59,103
Actually, it was a really
disappointing yacht party.

1013
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:01,439
- You remember that?
- It was the worst yacht party ever!

1014
00:49:01,522 --> 00:49:03,202
- It was terrible.
- Oh!

1015
00:49:03,232 --> 00:49:04,900
But, speaking of great parties,

1016
00:49:04,984 --> 00:49:07,695
you guys have to come
to the Hamptons this weekend.

1017
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:10,197
We're having a few of my friends over

1018
00:49:10,281 --> 00:49:11,991
at my charming little beach house.

1019
00:49:12,074 --> 00:49:13,200
That sounds lovely.

1020
00:49:13,284 --> 00:49:15,404
Well, I was gonna take
my helicopter out anyway, so...

1021
00:49:15,453 --> 00:49:18,581
So funny. I was gonna offer you guys
a ride in my helicopter.

1022
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:21,584
That's so sweet, darling,
but better we take our own.

1023
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:25,421
Nat and I might wanna hit the, er,
old Caperoo, if you know what I mean.

1024
00:49:25,504 --> 00:49:28,966
- Oh, I know what you mean. I see you.
- I... I don't. What does that mean?

1025
00:49:30,593 --> 00:49:33,012
You two have such amazing chemistry.

1026
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:35,014
Maybe we should swap.

1027
00:49:40,352 --> 00:49:42,188
- She's joking. Yeah, she's joking.
- What?

1028
00:49:42,897 --> 00:49:44,315
Well, what do you think? Hamptons?

1029
00:49:45,483 --> 00:49:47,359
You had me at hello-copter.

1030
00:50:10,174 --> 00:50:11,175
This lobster...

1031
00:50:11,926 --> 00:50:13,302
is the size of a cat.

1032
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:15,095
Yet it's...

1033
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:17,348
as tender as a marshmallow.

1034
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:19,558
"Tender as a marshmallow."

1035
00:50:20,518 --> 00:50:22,228
You are beguiling.

1036
00:50:23,187 --> 00:50:25,940
Did you just learn that word?
'Cause you tend to say it a lot.

1037
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:27,775
If you want me to stop saying it, I will.

1038
00:50:28,526 --> 00:50:31,028
But you're gonna have to stop
being so damn beguiling.

1039
00:50:32,238 --> 00:50:35,074
Oh. Sorry, it's my father.

1040
00:50:35,157 --> 00:50:36,157
Y'ello?

1041
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:46,585
It's so good to see you guys.
Thanks for coming.

1042
00:50:46,669 --> 00:50:47,670
Thank you. Thank you.

1043
00:50:47,753 --> 00:50:50,548
Okay. Oh, you're squeezing some too, yeah.

1044
00:50:50,631 --> 00:50:52,550
Okay, we're gettin' it. Oh.

1045
00:50:52,633 --> 00:50:53,860
Oh, God.

1046
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:55,886
- Oh!
- There you go. Get on you...

1047
00:50:56,804 --> 00:50:57,930
Phew.

1048
00:51:00,391 --> 00:51:01,559
- Hey.
- Hey.

1049
00:51:03,227 --> 00:51:06,313
So, you and Blake
are kind of a thing, huh?

1050
00:51:06,397 --> 00:51:08,607
Well, you and Isabella...

1051
00:51:08,691 --> 00:51:09,567
- I know.
- Huh?

1052
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:12,420
Who'd have thought that me and you
would both end up with just, like...

1053
00:51:12,444 --> 00:51:13,487
perfect humans?

1054
00:51:14,196 --> 00:51:15,364
- Yeah. It's...
- Crazy.

1055
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:17,950
- Yeah, really... really crazy.
- Yeah.

1056
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:20,076
Aah.

1057
00:51:20,578 --> 00:51:21,704
You know what's funny?

1058
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:25,499
The fact that all those rich ladies
have crabs?

1059
00:51:25,583 --> 00:51:26,917
Well, yes, that is funny.

1060
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:29,920
But, at one point, I thought
it would actually be me and you

1061
00:51:30,004 --> 00:51:31,380
that would end up together.

1062
00:51:32,006 --> 00:51:33,006
You did?

1063
00:51:33,424 --> 00:51:34,633
Yeah, in the beginning.

1064
00:51:35,676 --> 00:51:37,845
Well, why didn't you ask me out, then?

1065
00:51:39,471 --> 00:51:42,224
Why don't... why don't you just, like,
ask me out right now?

1066
00:51:42,308 --> 00:51:43,976
I did.

1067
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:45,686
All the time. You'd always say no.

1068
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:47,313
You'd shoot me down, and...

1069
00:51:47,396 --> 00:51:49,231
And then we became
such good friends, so...

1070
00:51:49,315 --> 00:51:50,733
What are you talking about?

1071
00:51:51,317 --> 00:51:52,860
Uh... I never shot you down.

1072
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,404
I asked you out, like, a million times.

1073
00:51:56,196 --> 00:51:59,199
For, like, drinks
at happy hour after work,

1074
00:51:59,283 --> 00:52:01,910
or to go to the karaoke bar
with your kickball team.

1075
00:52:01,994 --> 00:52:05,873
I didn't wanna sit there and listen to you
chat about some girl you had a crush on.

1076
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:09,460
Okay, why do you say kickball team
like it's a bad thing? Hm?

1077
00:52:10,002 --> 00:52:12,838
The New York Kick Bockers
are elite level athletes.

1078
00:52:12,921 --> 00:52:14,131
It's true.

1079
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:16,884
- I'm a jock out there. I'm a jock.
- Come on!

1080
00:52:17,301 --> 00:52:18,981
- You are such an idiot.
- Mush?

1081
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:20,512
Mush?

1082
00:52:20,596 --> 00:52:21,764
Hey. Be right there.

1083
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,642
Are you comfortable with that nickname?

1084
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:26,477
It seems kind of like a negative.

1085
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:27,770
Oh, you don't like it?

1086
00:52:28,604 --> 00:52:31,815
I think it's kind of cute.
Hurts to do, but it's kind of cute, right?

1087
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:37,488
It's time! Okay.

1088
00:52:38,447 --> 00:52:39,531
Attention, everyone.

1089
00:52:40,115 --> 00:52:41,115
Eyes up here.

1090
00:52:41,575 --> 00:52:45,412
Hi, everyone, and thank you so much
for coming to this modest little thing

1091
00:52:45,496 --> 00:52:47,414
we threw together last minute.

1092
00:52:47,498 --> 00:52:51,168
I think we all know the story
of how Isabella and I met,

1093
00:52:51,669 --> 00:52:53,379
but I will tell it again.

1094
00:52:53,462 --> 00:52:54,797
I was walking.

1095
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:58,217
Yeah, with me, his best friend. I'm...
I'm his best friend, so...

1096
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:00,219
Yep, I was just walking,

1097
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:02,971
and I saw this beautiful woman
choking, so...

1098
00:53:03,055 --> 00:53:04,640
- Like...
- Yeah.

1099
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:05,891
So I ran up to her...

1100
00:53:06,558 --> 00:53:08,018
and gave her the Heimlich...

1101
00:53:08,477 --> 00:53:10,104
and then she gave me her heart.

1102
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:11,480
Aww!

1103
00:53:11,563 --> 00:53:12,606
That's gross.

1104
00:53:13,524 --> 00:53:15,192
Isabella, you are totally...

1105
00:53:15,776 --> 00:53:17,236
and utterly yourself.

1106
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:20,698
And you are so confident,

1107
00:53:20,781 --> 00:53:23,742
and you're never afraid
to go after what you want.

1108
00:53:23,826 --> 00:53:27,246
And even though I am so not worthy...

1109
00:53:28,831 --> 00:53:29,957
From <i>Wayne's World.</i>

1110
00:53:31,542 --> 00:53:32,542
It's crazy that...

1111
00:53:33,168 --> 00:53:35,045
that what you want is me.

1112
00:53:36,171 --> 00:53:38,757
- I do.
- Awww!

1113
00:53:38,841 --> 00:53:41,593
Which is why this is not just a party.

1114
00:53:41,677 --> 00:53:42,511
<i>♪ Ba-ba-da! ♪</i>

1115
00:53:42,594 --> 00:53:44,346
Surprise! It's our wedding!

1116
00:53:45,556 --> 00:53:46,682
We're getting married!

1117
00:53:46,765 --> 00:53:48,892
What the f...

1118
00:53:48,976 --> 00:53:51,687
So we're getting married tomorrow,
and tonight we're going into town

1119
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:54,690
- for some karaoke!
- Coming! Karaoke tonight!

1120
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:03,532
God, what was the theme of this wedding?
Easter at Elton John's house?

1121
00:54:03,615 --> 00:54:06,535
Donny, wh... How the hell did you get here?

1122
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:08,078
- Um...
- Come here.

1123
00:54:11,874 --> 00:54:14,501
I stole your password
and then I used Find My iPhone.

1124
00:54:14,585 --> 00:54:17,296
And then I took a bus here like an animal.
Oh, my goodness.

1125
00:54:17,379 --> 00:54:21,383
I sat next to a woman eating spaghetti
out of a Ziploc bag. Uh, no.

1126
00:54:21,467 --> 00:54:23,719
- Okay. I don't need the play-by-gay.
- And then...

1127
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:26,054
It's Josh. It was never Blake.

1128
00:54:26,138 --> 00:54:28,223
Okay, I have to get together with Josh.

1129
00:54:28,307 --> 00:54:29,183
Oh, my God.

1130
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:31,310
Yeah, and the weirdest thing
just happened.

1131
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:33,872
He just said to me that he thought
we'd always end up together.

1132
00:54:33,896 --> 00:54:35,056
But now he's getting married.

1133
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:37,667
What? So the best friend you've always
had a ton of chemistry with

1134
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:38,984
is the guy for you?

1135
00:54:39,067 --> 00:54:40,903
Oh, my God,
who could've seen that coming?

1136
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:42,706
Except every single person ever
of all time?

1137
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,282
- Oh, well, sorry.
- Okay.

1138
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:47,284
I got distracted by Blake's wealth,

1139
00:54:47,367 --> 00:54:50,287
and his face and his, um... giant penis.

1140
00:54:50,913 --> 00:54:52,331
Okay, caller, please hold.

1141
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:54,841
I thought you said
you two couldn't have sex.

1142
00:54:54,875 --> 00:54:57,002
Erm... No, we can't, but...

1143
00:54:57,961 --> 00:55:00,172
- Of course I had to sneak a peek.
- That's my booch.

1144
00:55:00,255 --> 00:55:02,508
Once or twice.
"Sorry, I'm just going to the toilet."

1145
00:55:02,591 --> 00:55:03,467
Oh, my God.

1146
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:05,636
- Yes.
- Mental picture. Mental picture.

1147
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:07,054
That is a sexy move.

1148
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:08,222
Okay, the point is...

1149
00:55:08,764 --> 00:55:10,474
- it's Josh, okay?
- Yeah.

1150
00:55:11,016 --> 00:55:12,851
And it was always Josh.

1151
00:55:13,227 --> 00:55:15,107
'Cause he's such a nerd
and he's so sweet and...

1152
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:17,898
he just... like, he really gets me,

1153
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:20,901
and that one time when I thought
he was moving away forever...

1154
00:55:21,485 --> 00:55:22,611
I cried all night.

1155
00:55:23,487 --> 00:55:24,822
And I never ever told him.

1156
00:55:25,614 --> 00:55:28,574
On a scale of baguette to surface-to-air
missile, how giant are we talking?

1157
00:55:28,617 --> 00:55:29,868
- Seriously?
- Mm-hm.

1158
00:55:29,952 --> 00:55:31,912
It'll help determine
the advice that I give you.

1159
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:35,499
I don't know,
it's, like, the size of a pepper grinder.

1160
00:55:35,582 --> 00:55:38,062
The kind you have at home?
The kind a waiter has to bring over?

1161
00:55:38,836 --> 00:55:40,516
The kind that the waiter
has to bring over.

1162
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:42,965
My God.

1163
00:55:43,048 --> 00:55:44,383
I... I've swallowed my tongue.

1164
00:55:45,509 --> 00:55:48,470
You don't tell somebody you thought
you'd end up together...

1165
00:55:48,554 --> 00:55:51,234
the night before your wedding,
unless you're having second thoughts.

1166
00:55:51,306 --> 00:55:52,975
- Mm-mm. No.
- So I can't let him marry

1167
00:55:53,058 --> 00:55:54,309
that beautiful creature.

1168
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:56,352
No.

1169
00:55:56,395 --> 00:55:57,604
I have to stop that wedding.

1170
00:55:57,688 --> 00:56:00,649
You are so totally right,
you should totally stop this wedding!

1171
00:56:00,732 --> 00:56:03,443
- I'm stopping this wedding.

despises it more than,

Oh!

01:01:00,157 --> 01:01:02,534
Oh, yes!

1269
01:01:09,624 --> 01:01:11,668
How did everyone know the choreography?

1270
01:01:11,751 --> 01:01:13,044
That was weird.

1271
01:01:13,962 --> 01:01:15,297
It doesn't make any sense.

1272
01:01:16,214 --> 01:01:18,550
Honestly, you know what makes no sense?

1273
01:01:18,633 --> 01:01:20,385
Is marrying someone you just met.

1274
01:01:21,887 --> 01:01:24,055
I knew you were gonna
be weird about this.

1275
01:01:24,139 --> 01:01:25,432
Because it's weird.

1276
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:28,852
We met under, like,
really intense circumstances.

1277
01:01:28,935 --> 01:01:31,313
You know, it, like...
like, speeds things up.

1278
01:01:32,647 --> 01:01:35,567
That's dopamine,
that's your brain on drugs.

1279
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:36,860
- Aah...
- It is.

1280
01:01:37,402 --> 01:01:39,654
What are you gonna do
when the drugs wear off?

1281
01:01:41,281 --> 01:01:42,407
I don't know. We'll...

1282
01:01:43,450 --> 01:01:44,618
figure it out.

1283
01:01:46,203 --> 01:01:48,663
Don't you wanna figure it out
with someone you really know?

1284
01:01:50,248 --> 01:01:53,084
I guess that's why they say
you should marry your best friend.

1285
01:02:04,012 --> 01:02:05,430
Maybe in a different world.

1286
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:09,601
I should get goin'.

1287
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:12,812
Big day tomorrow.

1288
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:16,732
Yeah.

1289
01:02:18,318 --> 01:02:19,444
Yep, big day.

1290
01:02:25,325 --> 01:02:28,161
Oh, that's so great, Dad.
I'm so glad you love it.

1291
01:02:28,245 --> 01:02:31,164
You're right, it is innovative.
And I came up with it all by myself.

1292
01:02:31,831 --> 01:02:35,085
I'll fill in the architects and they can
work up the official plans and models.

1293
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:36,628
Okay? Goodbye.

1294
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:41,841
Oh, good morning, beautiful.

1295
01:02:41,925 --> 01:02:43,510
Are they my plans?

1296
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:47,055
God, you look beautiful
in the morning light.

1297
01:02:47,138 --> 01:02:49,808
Were you just pitching my idea
and passing it off as your own?

1298
01:02:49,891 --> 01:02:50,934
No.

1299
01:02:51,017 --> 01:02:53,144
Well, I saw them
when I was in your apartment.

1300
01:02:53,228 --> 01:02:56,815
And the idea was for me, so...
whose idea is it, really?

1301
01:02:57,774 --> 01:02:59,776
- Mine.
- Whoa. Hey.

1302
01:03:01,027 --> 01:03:03,947
Don't know where all this crazy
assertiveness is coming from.

1303
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:06,759
Let's be honest, you weren't gonna be able
to pitch it to me now anyways.

1304
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:10,036
- Yeah, I was. Why wouldn't I?
- No, you... No, you weren't.

1305
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:12,556
Darling, now that you're with me,
you're not gonna be working anymore.

1306
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:16,167
My girl, slumming it in the realm
of the employed? Not on my watch.

1307
01:03:16,251 --> 01:03:18,753
Mmm... I like being an architect.

1308
01:03:18,837 --> 01:03:19,921
Come on, don't be silly.

1309
01:03:21,006 --> 01:03:24,092
We should also, at some point,
talk about changing your name.

1310
01:03:24,175 --> 01:03:27,679
You're really projecting.
You think, what, we're gonna get married?

1311
01:03:27,762 --> 01:03:29,389
Well, yes.

1312
01:03:30,265 --> 01:03:31,945
And obviously,
we'll change your last name.

1313
01:03:32,017 --> 01:03:34,519
But no, I'm talking about your first name.
Natalie?

1314
01:03:35,061 --> 01:03:37,397
I really don't think it's gonna work
in my circles.

1315
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:39,399
So I was thinking Georgina.

1316
01:03:39,482 --> 01:03:42,819
What do you think? Georgina?

1317
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:44,988
- You are...
- Beguiling.

1318
01:03:45,071 --> 01:03:46,071
...horrible.

1319
01:03:47,866 --> 01:03:49,409
You're a horrible person.

1320
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:53,660
Okay, I... I think you're just tired,
darling. Why don't you go back to bed?

1321
01:03:53,705 --> 01:03:55,165
Why don't you piss off?

1322
01:03:59,961 --> 01:04:01,254
It is so sad...

1323
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:04,174
to watch someone you love
go mad with ambition.

1324
01:04:04,591 --> 01:04:06,593
- Do you know who said that?
- No.

1325
01:04:06,968 --> 01:04:08,136
And now you never will.

1326
01:04:12,015 --> 01:04:13,141
I could Google it.

1327
01:04:28,114 --> 01:04:29,866
Erm... Where are you going?

1328
01:04:30,367 --> 01:04:32,243
- Home, booch.
- Home?

1329
01:04:32,744 --> 01:04:35,538
- The wedding starts in, like, 20 minutes.
- Uh, yeah.

1330
01:04:35,622 --> 01:04:37,123
- I don't give a shit.
- What?

1331
01:04:37,207 --> 01:04:39,125
I tried to just be open.

1332
01:04:39,209 --> 01:04:41,753
I tried to get Josh
to fall in love with me,

1333
01:04:41,836 --> 01:04:43,630
but that's not on the cards.

1334
01:04:44,964 --> 01:04:47,384
Not for a girl like me. Mm-mm.

1335
01:04:47,467 --> 01:04:49,552
Not even in this dumb, perfect world.

1336
01:04:58,895 --> 01:05:01,106
You know, when I was younger...

1337
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:06,653
I was so afraid
to put myself out there for love

1338
01:05:06,736 --> 01:05:09,906
that I became this quirky little queen

1339
01:05:09,989 --> 01:05:13,326
that just followed all my handsome
gay guy friends around.

1340
01:05:13,410 --> 01:05:15,328
Like I was a pilot fish. Ugh!

1341
01:05:15,412 --> 01:05:16,621
And I would make 'em laugh,

1342
01:05:16,704 --> 01:05:19,707
and I would find, like,
the best parties to go to,

1343
01:05:19,791 --> 01:05:22,877
and I would always comfort them
when their hearts were broken.

1344
01:05:24,045 --> 01:05:25,880
But you know what nobody ever knew?

1345
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:28,590
That my heart...

1346
01:05:29,217 --> 01:05:30,677
was constantly broken.

1347
01:05:33,388 --> 01:05:34,388
Constantly.

1348
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:38,476
I mean, and how could they?

1349
01:05:39,352 --> 01:05:40,770
I never let them see it.

1350
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:45,859
And it wasn't until I met
this palm reader in Ibiza,

1351
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:47,861
and she said to me, she said...

1352
01:05:48,570 --> 01:05:50,738
"You can search the entire universe...

1353
01:05:52,031 --> 01:05:54,451
and never find a being
more worthy of love...

1354
01:05:55,535 --> 01:05:56,535
than yourself."

1355
01:05:59,497 --> 01:06:02,250
So that's why I'm such the happy
little whore that I am today.

1356
01:06:02,417 --> 01:06:04,794
'Cause I love my bitchy little ass.

1357
01:06:07,547 --> 01:06:08,965
Who do you love, Natalie?

1358
01:06:16,097 --> 01:06:17,097
Josh.

1359
01:06:17,765 --> 01:06:19,893
I've never had the chance
to tell him that.

1360
01:06:20,643 --> 01:06:22,187
I need to tell him that.

1361
01:06:22,270 --> 01:06:23,605
Right now. Erm...

1362
01:06:24,189 --> 01:06:27,192
Oh, I'm never gonna make it.
But I have to try.

1363
01:06:27,275 --> 01:06:30,320
Oh, my God, of course. Why am I so dumb?

1364
01:06:30,403 --> 01:06:32,906
It was always gonna come down
to running to stop the wedding!

1365
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:34,324
Well, then, you run, girl.

1366
01:06:34,866 --> 01:06:37,535
You run like a sexy 18-year-old
in a coming out novel

1367
01:06:37,619 --> 01:06:40,459
who just realized that they're in love
with their theater partner, Ryan.

1368
01:06:41,372 --> 01:06:42,372
Get it!

- Natalie?
- Josh.

1388
01:07:30,964 --> 01:07:33,591
Oi, I just need one second.
Sorry.

1389
01:07:33,675 --> 01:07:35,885
I basically just ran,
like, a half marathon.

1390
01:07:36,511 --> 01:07:38,263
Oh, with no sports bra.

1391
01:07:38,346 --> 01:07:40,932
Natalie, what are you doing?

1392
01:07:41,015 --> 01:07:42,559
I'm here to stop the wedding.

1393
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:46,312
Don't worry, everyone, it's, erm...

1394
01:07:46,729 --> 01:07:50,358
She's clearly out of breath and her mind.

1395
01:07:50,441 --> 01:07:52,569
Are you feeling okay, honey?

1396
01:07:52,652 --> 01:07:54,821
'Cause you know, he's mine, right?

1397
01:07:55,738 --> 01:07:58,032
We have a... soul connection.

1398
01:07:58,116 --> 01:07:59,284
Awww!

1399
01:07:59,367 --> 01:08:01,953
Er, no, she doesn't even know Josh.

1400
01:08:02,036 --> 01:08:03,580
What? Of course I know Josh.

1401
01:08:03,663 --> 01:08:04,664
Really?

1402
01:08:06,082 --> 01:08:07,750
Uh, what's his favorite vegetable, then?

1403
01:08:08,293 --> 01:08:11,337
Well, that's random.
No one has a favorite vegetable.

1404
01:08:11,421 --> 01:08:14,382
See? She doesn't even know Josh.
It's tableside guac.

1405
01:08:14,465 --> 01:08:15,883
That's not even a real vegetable.

1406
01:08:15,967 --> 01:08:16,801
It is to him.

1407
01:08:16,884 --> 01:08:19,178
Technically, it is.
It's avocados, smashed.

1408
01:08:19,262 --> 01:08:20,263
- Stop it.
- Sorry.

1409
01:08:20,346 --> 01:08:21,222
Josh.

1410
01:08:21,306 --> 01:08:23,349
I know I don't have legs for days,

1411
01:08:23,433 --> 01:08:25,977
and I'm not some yoga... whatever the sh...

1412
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:28,730
Yoga ambassador. A yoga ambassador.

1413
01:08:28,813 --> 01:08:31,899
Ambassadors are for countries,
not for stretching.

1414
01:08:32,859 --> 01:08:34,861
Josh. Look...

1415
01:08:35,737 --> 01:08:38,364
I know you think Isabella
is the girl of your dreams.

1416
01:08:40,074 --> 01:08:41,701
But what if you're wrong?

1417
01:08:43,244 --> 01:08:44,287
Nat...

1418
01:08:44,996 --> 01:08:47,123
Okay, yeah, I'll never look like her.

1419
01:08:48,916 --> 01:08:49,916
But...

1420
01:08:50,209 --> 01:08:52,378
I'm smart and kind and funny

1421
01:08:52,962 --> 01:08:53,962
and...

1422
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:55,506
I'm passionate about work,

1423
01:08:56,049 --> 01:08:58,926
and I'm really weirdly good at karaoke.

1424
01:08:59,010 --> 01:09:00,010
Josh...

1425
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:05,016
You should choose me, you should love me.

1426
01:09:06,017 --> 01:09:07,268
Because I love...

1427
01:09:08,645 --> 01:09:09,979
I love...

1428
01:09:26,079 --> 01:09:27,080
I love me.

1429
01:09:28,289 --> 01:09:29,374
Holy crap.

1430
01:09:30,917 --> 01:09:31,917
I love me.

1431
01:09:34,379 --> 01:09:35,499
Oh, my God, this whole time,

1432
01:09:35,546 --> 01:09:39,008
I thought I had to get somebody else
to fall in love with me, but I...

1433
01:09:40,051 --> 01:09:41,135
I had to love me.

1434
01:09:45,348 --> 01:09:47,016
Okay, I'm just gonna go.

1435
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:49,394
Just to be clear,
you're not still stopping the wedding?

1436
01:09:49,477 --> 01:09:51,354
No, just go... carry on.

1437
01:09:51,437 --> 01:09:53,523
You guys, erm... Yeah, do your thing.

1438
01:09:53,606 --> 01:09:56,067
I'm gonna do me.
Good luck with everything.

1439
01:09:56,150 --> 01:09:58,528
I don't have high hopes
for what's going on there.

1440
01:09:58,611 --> 01:10:02,699
Josh and Iz, what's their couple name
gonna be? Jiz?

1441
01:10:02,782 --> 01:10:04,575
Love!

1442
01:10:04,659 --> 01:10:05,993
It's crazy, right?

1443
01:10:16,754 --> 01:10:18,881
I guess
I don't really have a choice, do I?

- Hi.

1519
01:14:01,562 --> 01:14:02,980
I know it was only like one day,

1520
01:14:03,064 --> 01:14:05,691
but I missed you, like, a lot,
an unhealthy amount.

1521
01:14:05,775 --> 01:14:07,193

1523

But please, okay,

1524
01:14:11,656 --> 01:14:14,367
you need to promise me
that we will never ever fight again.

1525
01:14:14,450 --> 01:14:16,035
What? We would never fight.

1526
01:14:16,118 --> 01:14:18,704
Mostly because you let me
watch movies all day.

1527
01:14:18,788 --> 01:14:21,874
Well, about that, I was thinking
that we cut back on the movies.

1528
01:14:22,583 --> 01:14:24,061
- You're right, totally right.
- Yeah.

1529
01:14:24,085 --> 01:14:25,628
I could stop whenever I want.

1530
01:14:25,711 --> 01:14:27,046

1531
01:14:27,129 --> 01:14:28,381
Erm... How about one a day?

1532
01:14:28,464 --> 01:14:29,382
How about none a week?

1533
01:14:29,465 --> 01:14:30,675
Okay, tough but fair.

1534
01:14:30,758 --> 01:14:32,093
Yeah, like my leg hair.

1535
01:14:32,176 --> 01:14:34,428

Okay, bye.

01:14:35,638 --> 01:14:36,681
- Whoa.
- Let's go.

1538
01:14:40,351 --> 01:14:42,271
Perfect. Let's get some coffee.

1539
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:43,688
Actually, I don't do that.

1540
01:14:44,939 --> 01:14:45,939
What do you do?

1541
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:47,942

1542

1545
01:14:55,533 --> 01:14:57,410

1546
01:14:57,493 --> 01:14:59,453
Well, I am. I'm ready.

1547
01:14:59,996 --> 01:15:01,038
Ow! Oh.

1548
01:15:01,539 --> 01:15:06,669
Okay, Mr. Lewis, I've been thinking
a lot lately about what we value,

1549
01:15:07,003 --> 01:15:11,132
what we deem worthy of investing
our time and love

1550
01:15:11,215 --> 01:15:13,926
and, of course, our money into, so...

1551
01:15:14,010 --> 01:15:17,054
as we design your exciting new hotel,

1552
01:15:17,513 --> 01:15:20,349
I would like to first focus
on the parking garage.

1553
01:15:20,975 --> 01:15:22,351
The parking garage?

1554
01:15:23,769 --> 01:15:24,854
Yep.

1555
01:15:25,354 --> 01:15:29,025
Think about it.
They're dark... they're closed off.

1556
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:34,238
Nobody ever really notices them.

1557
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:38,701
But what if we open them up?

1558
01:15:40,828 --> 01:15:42,121
What if we actually...

1559
01:15:42,955 --> 01:15:44,373
made something of them?

1560
01:15:45,041 --> 01:15:46,250
Made them bright and airy...

1561
01:15:46,876 --> 01:15:49,420
and there were glass walls everywhere?

1562
01:15:49,503 --> 01:15:50,963
And then, suddenly...

1563
01:15:51,756 --> 01:15:53,966
something that was invisible,

1564
01:15:54,050 --> 01:15:56,635
something nobody ever cared about

1565
01:15:56,719 --> 01:15:58,179
or looked twice at...

1566
01:15:59,346 --> 01:16:01,390
suddenly, they're not invisible anymore.

1567
01:16:02,183 --> 01:16:03,934
People actually look at them and...

1568
01:16:04,727 --> 01:16:05,728
see beauty.

1569
01:16:07,438 --> 01:16:08,522
They see something...

1570
01:16:09,231 --> 01:16:10,231
at least.

1571
01:16:11,192 --> 01:16:13,069
I think that could be,
like, really special.

1572
01:16:13,152 --> 01:16:14,152
Hm.

1573
01:16:18,282 --> 01:16:19,617
It's actually not a bad idea.

1574
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:20,700
Thank you.

1575
01:16:21,035 --> 01:16:23,370
It's actually a great idea,
that I thought of.

1576
01:16:24,246 --> 01:16:26,123
And I'm just gonna get started on it.

1577
01:16:26,624 --> 01:16:27,958
All right, let's do it.

1578
01:16:28,042 --> 01:16:30,169
Okay, I'll see you guys later. Peace out.

1579
01:16:31,504 --> 01:16:32,838
What does beguiling mean?

1580
01:16:39,637 --> 01:16:42,306
And you! You need to stop living
in a fantasy land.

1581
01:16:42,848 --> 01:16:44,642
Hello? Hello?

1582
01:16:44,725 --> 01:16:45,768
Hello, Josh!

1583
01:16:45,851 --> 01:16:46,727
Oh. Hey.

1584
01:16:46,811 --> 01:16:48,229
- Yeah, okay.
- What's up, Nat?

1585
01:16:48,312 --> 01:16:51,023
You need to stop staring out that window

1586
01:16:51,107 --> 01:16:53,692
at some stupid girl
in some stupid little swimsuit.

1587
01:16:53,776 --> 01:16:55,986
Okay? That's not all
it's cracked up to be.

1588
01:16:56,070 --> 01:16:58,405
You need to start living
in the real world,

1589
01:16:58,489 --> 01:17:00,699
and stop thinking
that you're gonna get with some model,

1590
01:17:00,783 --> 01:17:02,368
and that that's gonna make you happy.

1591
01:17:02,451 --> 01:17:03,327
You done?

1592
01:17:03,410 --> 01:17:05,454
Okay, here, take a seat.

1593
01:17:06,122 --> 01:17:07,706
Come on, sit down.

1594
01:17:07,790 --> 01:17:08,999
- You're not...
- Come on.

1595
01:17:09,083 --> 01:17:10,894
- You're not pushing me again?
- No, no, no, no.

1596
01:17:10,918 --> 01:17:12,503
Hang on. Okay.

1597
01:17:12,586 --> 01:17:14,255
Stay right there, don't move.

1598
01:17:15,339 --> 01:17:16,339
Just...

1599
01:17:39,155 --> 01:17:41,115
So what do you see
when you look at the billboard?

1600
01:17:57,298 --> 01:17:58,424
I was lookin' at you.

1601
01:18:01,177 --> 01:18:02,303
I'm always lookin' at you.

1602
01:18:03,345 --> 01:18:04,345
Josh...

1603
01:18:05,848 --> 01:18:06,974
You're such an idiot.

1604
01:18:18,110 --> 01:18:19,195
Okay.

1605
01:18:19,612 --> 01:18:21,614
Well!

1606
01:18:23,657 --> 01:18:25,409
Maybe we should go out sometime, then.

1607
01:18:25,492 --> 01:18:26,492
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1608
01:18:26,535 --> 01:18:27,971
- If you wanted to.
- That'd be great.

1609
01:18:27,995 --> 01:18:30,289
Okay. Yeah, good. Good... Great. Great.

1610
01:18:30,372 --> 01:18:31,957
- Yeah, let's...
- Yeah.

1611
01:18:32,625 --> 01:18:35,044
Why are we talkin'
like we're angry with each other?

1612
01:18:35,127 --> 01:18:37,607
I don't know. I was just on a roll
this morning, and now I'm...

1613
01:18:40,424 --> 01:18:42,009
Now I'm really happy.

1614
01:18:42,092 --> 01:18:43,761
So, uh, this weekend?

1615
01:18:44,595 --> 01:18:45,596
Karaoke or something?

1616
01:18:46,055 --> 01:18:47,348
Yeah, that'd be...

1617
01:18:48,015 --> 01:18:50,559
Yeah. I mean, I might outshine you, but...

1618
01:18:52,561 --> 01:18:53,729
- Okay, all right.
- Cool.

1619
01:19:08,202 --> 01:19:10,263
Yeah, it should...
...This is gonna take a long time.

1620
01:19:10,287 --> 01:19:12,206
That one takes a while sometimes.

1621
01:19:12,748 --> 01:19:14,375
Okay, there it is.

1622
01:19:43,445 --> 01:19:45,281
Oh...

1623
01:19:45,698 --> 01:19:47,491
Wait, did you just run down the stairs?

1624
01:19:47,574 --> 01:19:49,618
I'm trying to be calm,
but where are you going?

1625
01:19:49,702 --> 01:19:51,370
I'm just getting a coffee.

1626
01:19:51,453 --> 01:19:53,372
'Cause I'm now my own coffee bitch.

1627
01:19:53,455 --> 01:19:56,625
I just wanted to say I'm so proud of you.
Upstairs was amazing.

1628
01:19:56,709 --> 01:19:59,586
Just to be clear,
Josh does not complete me.

1629
01:19:59,712 --> 01:20:01,213
I complete myself.

1630
01:20:01,964 --> 01:20:03,173
You know, God...

1631
01:20:04,049 --> 01:20:05,509
Even though you were so cynical,

1632
01:20:05,592 --> 01:20:08,637
it looks like you have the dream job,
the guy that really likes you,

1633
01:20:08,721 --> 01:20:10,081
the really cool best friend, me...

1634
01:20:10,139 --> 01:20:13,559
It's like you are in one of those
love stories that you hate so much.

1635
01:20:16,395 --> 01:20:19,273
Yeah, all I need now
is some catchy musical number.
